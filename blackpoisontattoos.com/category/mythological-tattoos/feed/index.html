										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>THE MEANING OF THE OM SYMBOL </strong></p><p>‘Om’,&nbsp;‘Ohm’&nbsp;or&nbsp;‘Aum’&nbsp;is a sacred sound that is known generally, as the sound of the universe. Om is all encompassing, the essence of ultimate reality, and unifies everything in the universe. The vibrations that the Om sound creates are thought to energize, the chakras throughout the body.</p><p>Especially the third eye and crown chakras, which help us connect with our Divine selves.which is chanted to connect with and energize the chakras. </p><p>The Om symbol represents the sound in a visual form and has a lot of meaning behind it. </p><p>Om is one of the most important spiritual symbols and is found throughout many ancient Hindu texts, prayers and ceremonies.</p><p><strong>Elements of the Om Symbol</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The&nbsp;Om symbol is a combination of curves, a crescent and a dot. The meaning of the Om symbol, while purely looking at its visual form, the states of consciousness that&nbsp;Aum&nbsp;represents. The letter &#8216;A&#8217;&nbsp;represents the&nbsp;waking state, &#8216;U&#8217; represents the dream state and &#8216;M&#8217; is the unconscious state, or state of deep sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the symbol, the waking state is represented by the bottom curve.The dream state is the middle curve and the state of deep sleep is represented with the upper curve. </p><p>Om Shiva Tattoo, The crescent shape above the curves denotes Maya, or Illusion. Which is the obstacle that sits in the way of reaching the highest state of bliss. </p><p> The dot at the top of the symbol represents the absolute state. Which is the fourth state of consciousness and is absolute peace and bliss. This fourth state is believed to be the state in which someone could truly connect with the Divine.</p><p><strong>Who is Shiva?</strong></p><p>Shiva is the third god in the Hindu triumvirate. Om Shiva Tattoo, The triumvirate consists of three gods who are responsible for the creation, upkeep and destruction of the world. The other two gods are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/deities/brahma.shtml">Brahma</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/deities/vishnu.shtml">Vishnu</a>.</p><p>Brahma is the creator of the universe while Vishnu is the preserver of it. Shiva&#8217;s role is to destroy the universe in order to re-create it.</p><p>Hindus believe his powers of destruction and recreation are used even now to destroy the illusions and imperfections of this world, paving the way for beneficial change. According to Hindu belief, this destruction is not arbitrary, but constructive. Shiva is therefore seen as the source of both good and evil and is regarded as the one who combines many contradictory elements.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/om-shiva-tattoo/">Om Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mahamrityunjaya Mantra is one among the oldest and most important Mantra in Indian mythology and spirituality. This mantra belongs to Lord Shiva. It is a combination of three Hindi language words i.e. ‘Maha’, which means great, ‘Mrityun’ means death and ‘Jaya’ means victory, which turns into conqueror victory over death.It is also known as ‘Rudra Mantra’ or ‘Trayambakam Mantra’. The Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra is said to have been created by Rishi Markandeya. The Moon was once in trouble, cursed by King Daksha. Rishi Markandeya gave the Mahamritryunjaya Mantra to Sati, Daksha&#8217;s daughter, for the Moon.</p><p><strong>Lord Shiva Mantra Tattoo</strong></p><p><strong>Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra Tattoo</strong></p><p><span class="s1">त्रयम्बकं</span> <span class="s1">यजामहे</span> <span class="s1">सुगन्धिं</span> <span class="s1">पुष्टिवर्धनम्</span> <span class="s2">।</span> <span class="s1">उर्वारुकमिव</span> <span class="s1">बन्धनान्</span> <span class="s1">म्रुत्योर्मुक्षिय</span> <span class="s1">मामृतात्</span> <span class="s2">॥</span> Om Trayambakam Yajamahe, Sugandhim Pushti Vardhanam, Urvarukmiv Bandhanat, Mrityurmokshaya Mamratat.

Let not her name depart from your lips, never suffer it to leave your heart. And that you may obtain the assistance of her prayer, neglect not to walk in her footsteps. With her for guide, you shall never go astray; while invoking her, you shall never lose heart; so long as she is in your mind, you are safe from deception; while she holds your hand, you cannot fall; under her protection you have nothing to fear; if she walks before you, you shall not grow weary; if she shows you favor, you shall reach the goal.</p><p><strong>Mother Mary Tattoo</strong></p><p>The Virgin Mary tattoo is one of the Christian tattoos that are very popular and have been common for a long period of time. It originated from icons and paintings that could be done in churches. These paintings consisted of a lady who looked humble and beautiful and could be referred as a symbol of the Virgin Mary. Christians recognize Mary as the mother of Jesus whom she conceived by the help of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/mother-mary-tattoo/">Mother Mary Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the king of the jungle, the lion is inarguably one of the world’s most prominent symbols of power and leadership. In addition to representing supremacy, it is also a creature that is known for its courage and pride.</p><p>While some tattoos feature lions baring their teeth and appearing ferocious, others present their calm and peaceful side.</p><p>In a Biblical sense, a lion is considered to be a creature that defends the weak and watches over those with lesser strength than itself. In fact, Jesus Christ is referred to on countless occasions as “the lion of Judah.” By fusing their images together, this tattoo represents the fact that Christians see Jesus as a symbolic lion that has been sent to Earth to make up for their inadequacies.</p><p>The large size of this tattoo shows off the sizeable presence a lion’s power can have on those surrounding it. Because the elements of a lion’s mug are easy to enlarge, it makes for a gorgeous back piece that accentuates the natural curves and structure of the body.</p><p>While a lion’s flowing mane and bold features can make it a beautiful mural piece that takes up lots of space on your body, the image of a lion also looks pretty amazing when inked on back side of body.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/custom-lion-tattoo-design/">Custom Lion Tattoo Design</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiva tattoos, like the Hindu deity himself, generally consist of complex symbolism.</p><p>Shiva – sometimes referred to as Siwa or Siva – represents the duality of existence, both the creation of life and the destruction of it.</p><p>He is also said to be the image of sensuality and is sometimes depicted as having both male and female characteristics – expounding further on the manifold nature of life.</p><p>In addition to that, Shiva is also thought to be freer of souls and is often used in art to express a sort of opening up of the spirit. Despite the rich amount of symbolism associated with this god, many people like to use his image in tattoo art solely for its remarkable, uncanny beauty.</p><p>Most people who choose Shiva tattoos prefer to stick with traditional imagery. These pieces are usually quite colorful and detailed, showing the deity either sitting or dancing, alone or beside his eternal wife – the Mother goddess – Parvati.</p><p>Many of these pieces show Shiva in full body, usually in a state of fluid movement; however, others may depict the god from the waist up, showing the face, torso, and arms in great detail. Traditional styles may also be done in black or red outlines and may depict Shiva standing bare against the skin, or standing atop a lotus flower, surrounded by flames.</p><p>Some people like to use non-traditional imagery for their Shiva tattoos. One great example of this would be to play up the features of both genders, making one side curvaceous, soft and feminine, while the other side is straighter, muscular, and more masculine. It is not uncommon to see a Shiva tattoo that shows the god expressing both sides of his nature.</p><p>For example, his countenance may be peaceful, while the manner of his body may be harsh; conversely, his mouth may be presented in a twisted scream, while his body stands in a placid fashion.</p><p>Non-traditional Shiva pieces may also exaggerate certain features, like a ray of a yellow sun may burst forth from the right eye, silvery light from the left, and red flames from the center; the snake, which coils around his neck three times, may fade into colors that represent past, present, and future – such as gold, red and blue; while his hands, which are representative of the four cardinal directions, may point towards significant areas in each direction.</p><p>To the Hindu population, the image of this particular deity is thought to be incredibly potent; however, as the western culture becomes more enlightened in the ways of Eastern religion, Shiva tattoos are gaining in popularity. This is not surprising, as the visage of this god is not only stunning in appearance but full of promising symbolism.</p><p>We have a huge portfolio of <a href="/portfolio_category/lord-shiva-tattoos/">Shiva Tattoos</a>.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/shiva-tattoo-with-only-trishul-eye-snake/">Shiva Tattoo with Only Trishul, Eye &#038; Snake</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
