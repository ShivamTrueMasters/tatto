										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>collarbone tattoo A rose tattoo is one of the most prevalent patterns in the world. Both males and females embellish their bodies with this symbol, which has a very deep and complicated history.</p><p>Originally, this pattern has appeared in Persia, there a rose was considered to be only a male flower, but then diverse senses have been assigned to this pattern in divergent countries.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><p>Thus, for instance, in Greece this flower symbolized the blood of Aphrodite, in Rome it has been connected with the goddess Diana, who has transformed her lover into a rose, in Egypt it was a favorite flower of Isis, in Christian countries the rose has been associated with the blood of Christ. In the East, this flower was the sign of pure and sincere love.<a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/513128951292346699/?nic=1">https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/513128951292346699/?nic=1</a></p><p>collarbone tattoo, In the current world, the denotation of the rose depends on its color and it doesn’t matter where the tattoo will be placed.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A black rose denotes tragic love, various subcultures invest their own meaning. Hence, for example, goths reckon that the black rose is death, for anarchists the same symbol is the fight.</li><li>A white rose shows pure love and a faithful essence of its owner.</li><li>A red rose indicates passion, desire, and love, whereas a burgundy rose spells out the idea of inner harmony.</li><li>A blue rose represents a sophisticated nature of a human, who wears it. He or she renounces all rules and foundations, adopted in the society, besides, this person strives for something unattainable.</li><li>A yellow rose has altered its meaning: at first, it meant jealousy, but now it connotes dedication.</li><li>An orange rose conveys that the owner is enthusiastic and attractive.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/collarbone-tattoo/">Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Some Christians use the lion tattoo to symbolize Christian beliefs. The lion is also a symbolic figure to Islam, in which the lion and the sword represent power. The lion is also a solar animal. This means that the lion has sun-like qualities and characteristics. In many culture and beliefs, the lion is associated with the sun.
