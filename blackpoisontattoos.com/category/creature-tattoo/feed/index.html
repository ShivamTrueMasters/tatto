										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beetles have also caught the eye, and prayers, of those people seeking Divine intervention. By far, the most well-known beetle to grace the surface of religious artifacts is the Scarab Beetle. Known as&nbsp;<em>&#8216;The Creator&#8217;</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>&#8216;The Khepri&#8217;</em>&nbsp;in ancient Egypt, Scarab Beetles were believed to be a representation of the Sun God and the way they rolled their dung ball across the hot desert sands was said to be a cosmic re-enactment of the ancient Sun god,&nbsp;Atum, pushing the sun across the vast sky.</p><p>The Egyptian name for the Scarab Beetle (Kheper) translates into&nbsp;<em>&#8216;to come into existence and transform&#8217;</em>and their connection with the Divine accounts for why important Egyptians like pharaohs and noblemen were buried lots of Scarab Beetles and their tomb walls were filled with images of the insect in its spiritual quest to&nbsp;<em>&#8216;push the Sun across the sky&#8217;</em>.</p><p><strong>Bejeweled Scarabs were wrapped in the mummified pharaoh&#8217;s bandages in the belief that this would help him to reawaken in the land of the Dead and start his journey towards resurrection.</strong></p><p>Outside of the Egyptian spiritual realm, beetles became renowned as signs of good fortune. Ladybugs are common characters in children&#8217;s stories and play. Many non-profits that promote tolerance and peace use the image of an adorable Ladybug to easily convey their message. Who knows, it might bring your soul mate to you.</p><p><strong>The Meaning of Beetle Tattoo Designs</strong></p><p>The types of&nbsp;beetles&nbsp;on the face of the Earth are as numerous as the amount of sand on a beach. These include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Nobility</li><li>The Divine</li><li>Luck</li><li>Love</li><li>Prosperity and Abundance</li><li>Strength</li><li>Creation and Immortality</li><li>Organization and Discipline</li></ul><p><strong>Beetel-tattoo Design Variations</strong></p><p><strong>From the delicate contours and vibrant colors of the Ladybug to the strong outline of the Scarab Beetle, these tattoos come in all colors and sizes.</strong></p><p>Whether or not you add other elements to your design depends largely on the type of beetle you want to on your body.</p><p><strong>Scarab Beetle Tattoos</strong><br>
It&#8217;s hard to picture ancient Egypt and the famous tombs of her pharaohs. Without the iconic image of the Scarab Beetle. From tomb walls and chariots to official seals, the Scarab Beetle was a reminder of the pharaoh&#8217;s divine power to the ordinary citizens. Scarab Beetles are totems of&nbsp;Atum, the creator god and represent a connection to the powerful forces of Creation, Renewal, and Transformation.</p><p><strong>Ladybug Tattoos:&nbsp;</strong>Ladybugs bring Lady Luck&nbsp;whenever they fly by Legend has it that you&#8217;ll have luck and prosperity. If a ladybug lands on you. Ladybug Tattoos represent Love, Luck, and all life&#8217;s richest blessings. These tattoos are for&nbsp;Flower Power children&nbsp;and are more often embodiments of your love for Nature.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/beetel-tattoo/">Beetel Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sagittarius is the 9th sign that features in the zodiac wheel. It is also among the final 3 fire signs of the zodiac collection. It is mostly represented by an archer or the symbol of an archer. This archer will have a bow and an arrow and will be joined to a horse.</p><p><strong>Sagittarius Zodiac that shows half a person and half horse.</strong></p><p>The body of the human being is what will replace the head of the horse, but the other part is complete of a horse. The sign also represents people born between November the 23rd and December the 21st.</p><p>The Sagittarius sign or character can be applied on the body and they represent pried, passion, fury, courage, and independence.</p><p>The wearer of the tattoo will most likely have these personalities.</p><p>They are also persons that can face any sort of challenge, without fear.<br>
All of us are possessive about our identity and it means a lot to us. We express it in different ways and the sun sign tattoos are also a way of expressing our identity. People who belong to the Sagittarius sun sign are natural tattoo lovers as they are blessed with an artistic bent of mind. They love to explore and research and are also very fiery and straight-forward. The Sagittarius tattoos are best for conveying the fact that one was born under the ninth sign of the zodiac and is ruled by the fire element.</p><p>The tattoo has got a very sexy display and stands out from all other sun signs tattoos. The centaur and the archer represent the Sagittarians. The arrow is the symbol of the ardent and passionate sun sign. Men and women love both the designs. Those who want a simple and cute look generally go for the symbol while the ones wishing for an elaborate and catchy display choose the centaur and the archer.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/sagittarius-zodiac-sign-tattoo/">Sagittarius Zodiac Sign Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

At the same time, this charming animal is associated with some symbolic attributes, like a female deer or doe is regarded as an epitome of motherly love, kindness, and gentleness. On the other hand, a stag or male deer denotes fertility, virility and sexual prowess. In general sense, the deer tattoo relates with the symbolic meanings of nobility, peace, love, and kindness.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sparta was a warrior society in ancient Greece that reached the height of its power after defeating rival city-state Athens in the Peloponnesian War (431-404 B.C.). Spartan culture centered on loyalty to the state and military service. At age 7, Spartan boys entered a rigorous state-sponsored education, military training, and socialization program. Known as the Agoge, the system emphasized duty, discipline, and endurance. Despite their military prowess, the Spartans’ dominance was short-lived: In 371 B.C., they were defeated by Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra, and their empire went into a long period of decline.</p><p><strong>Spartan, also known as Lacedaemon.</strong></p><p>Sparta was an ancient Greek city-state located primarily in the present-day region of southern Greece called Laconia. The population of Sparta consisted of three main groups: the Spartans, or Spartiates, who were full citizens; the Helots, or serfs/slaves; and the Perioeci, who were neither slaves nor citizens. The Perioeci, whose name means “dwellers-around,” worked as craftsmen and traders, and built weapons for the Spartans</p><p><i><strong>Spartan Warrior Tattoo</strong></i></p><p><i>The word “Spartan” means self-restrained, simple, frugal and austere.&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>Spartan tattoo</strong></p><p>Spartan boys started their military training at age 7 when they left home and entered the Agoge. Spartans also valued knowledge, took education seriously and even had a democratic government. They were the most feared military army in the Greek world between the 4th and 6th century.</p><p>&nbsp;As you will see they speak to the individual’s approach to life, those around them and their beliefs.</p><p><strong>Honor</strong></p><p>Spartans had a reputation for being honorable men who would lay down their lives to protect their society, way of life and their fellow warrior. In today’s modern world honor is hard to come by, so many choose a tattoo like this to remind them that the right thing to do and the hardest thing to do are often the same and they need to make honorable choices.</p><p><strong>Bravery</strong></p><p>They embodied bravery and even today people still admire their resolve and want to remember that if the Spartans could face such terrible circumstances and still stand firm that they can overcome life’s obstacles as well.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/spartan-warrior-tattoo/">SPARTAN WARRIOR TATTOO</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Wolves live and hunt in packs, tight-knit family groups that increase their chances of survival.</p><p>Native Americans viewed the wolf as a totem animal or spirit sent to help guide us through life, symbolizing loyalty and perseverance. In legends, the wolf had great powers given by the Great Spirit. Wolves also had the power to change into people.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/wolf-tattoo-designs/">Wolf Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coverup Tattoo</p><p>The tiger’s eye<span class="s1"><a href="http://gemstone-dictionary.com/tigers-eye">&nbsp;</a>is more than gemstone</span>; it is a symbol of Focus, Patience, and Determination. A Tiger Eye Tattoo symbolizes your most primitive desires; you are moving and thinking simply on instinct and drive. The eye of the tiger represents the animal in its purest state; it is stalking, hungry, focused, and, most importantly, lethal.</p><p>When it comes to animal tattoos, the tiger ranks up there with the best of them. Tigers have been a part of fashion, magic acts, and carnivals for years. Their beautiful stripes make them very attractive in fashion, art, and tattoos. Although the lion is considered to be the king of the jungle, it is actually the tiger. The largest percentage of tigers live in the dense jungles of Asia. Due to the popularity of their fur coats, they&#8217;re on the endangered species list. The beauty and symbolism of the tiger has made it a highly sought-after tattoo.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The Bengal and Siberian tigers are absolutely beautiful animals. The Bengal is orange with black stripes, while the Siberian is white with black stripes.</li><li>They are deadly jungle predators. The humans who still live in the jungles where these tigers roam have to be on constant alert for them. One of the tiger&#8217;s strengths is his ability to hunt and ambush his prey without detection.</li><li>The tiger has played a very important role in Asian cultures, such as China and Japan. In these cultures, the tiger ranks right up there with the dragon. You may also see tiger tattoos that actually have a dragon.</li><li>Japanese Samurai had tigers on their crests.</li><li>As you have already read, the tiger is an endangered animal. Due to this fact, the tiger tattoo has become very important for those who care about the tiger species and conservation. These people wear the tiger tattoo with pride as a reminder of their work.</li><li>As of today, there are only a few thousand left in the entire world. The species became endangered after people had been hunting them for their fur.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/tiger-eye-tattoo/">Tiger Eye Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the king of the jungle, the lion is inarguably one of the world’s most prominent symbols of power and leadership. In addition to representing supremacy, it is also a creature that is known for its courage and pride.</p><p>While some tattoos feature lions baring their teeth and appearing ferocious, others present their calm and peaceful side.</p><p>In a Biblical sense, a lion is considered to be a creature that defends the weak and watches over those with lesser strength than itself. In fact, Jesus Christ is referred to on countless occasions as “the lion of Judah.” By fusing their images together, this tattoo represents the fact that Christians see Jesus as a symbolic lion that has been sent to Earth to make up for their inadequacies.</p><p>The large size of this tattoo shows off the sizeable presence a lion’s power can have on those surrounding it. Because the elements of a lion’s mug are easy to enlarge, it makes for a gorgeous back piece that accentuates the natural curves and structure of the body.</p><p>While a lion’s flowing mane and bold features can make it a beautiful mural piece that takes up lots of space on your body, the image of a lion also looks pretty amazing when inked on back side of body.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/custom-lion-tattoo-design/">Custom Lion Tattoo Design</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
