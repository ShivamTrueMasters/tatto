										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Karma Tattoo – Karma is the</strong>&nbsp;universal law that applies to each and every one of us.</p><p>It&nbsp;<strong>means</strong>&nbsp;simply that everything you&nbsp;<strong>do</strong>&nbsp;will come back to you.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">This&nbsp;<strong>tattoo is the</strong>&nbsp;reminder that Good&nbsp;<strong>karma</strong>&nbsp;comes from truly good actions. … It doesn’t work so well when you&nbsp;<strong>do</strong>&nbsp;good things, but for completely selfish reasons.</a></p><p>Karma is a key component of many Eastern religions and philosophies, including Hinduism, Buddhism and even Taoism. Remember that harming none includes harming yourself! &nbsp;This tattoo is the reminder that Good karma comes from truly good actions. It doesn’t work so well when you do good things, but for completely selfish reasons. And it absolutely does not work when you do things only for the purpose of getting a karmic reward.</p><p>Karma is in general formed by the combination of a person’s actions and intents. It depends not only on what the person actually does but also by the nature of their inner self.</p><p>The traditional, philosophical uses of karma have helped to connect the word. With a sense of “cosmic justice” in the Western vocabulary. In this sense, karma is often to refer to a mystic. The indefinable force that influences one’s immediate future. Western usage includes two distinct types of karma. There’s “good karma,” which one generates by doing good deeds and treating others well, and “bad karma,” which one creates by being inconsiderate and treating others poorly.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">Having a net amount of “good karma” will lead to good fortune in the future. While a net sum of “bad karma” will lead to hardship or bad luck.</a></p><p>The belief in rebirth, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">samsara</a>, as a potentially endless series of worldly existences in which every being is caught up was already associated with the doctrine of karma in pre-Buddhist India, and it was accepted by virtually all Buddhist traditions. According to the doctrine, good conduct brings a pleasant and happy result and creates a tendency toward similar good acts. While bad conduct brings an evil result and creates a tendency toward similar evil acts.,</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/karma-tattoo/">Karma Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are looking for a Sister Tattoo that you can share with your sister, then we have some amazing styles that you can choose from. Getting any type of ink is a big commitment, especially if you are getting it with someone. Getting a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">tattoo</a>&nbsp;with someone else is serious business, so you want to make sure that you both love it. Sisters always have a strong bond and a tattoo can be a symbol of that bond. A sister’s bond is unbreakable, you know that and you want to share that. A sister can be so much more than a family member. A sister can be your best friend, a confidant, and your one true soul mate.</p><p>By getting a tattoo with your sister, you can strengthen the bond of friendship and love so much more. It’s a great way to show your love. There is a lot of meaning in matching tattoos. If you want to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">symbolize your&nbsp;</a>sisterhood, then try out a matching tattoo design. It will be a fun way for the both of you to connect together. It will be something special that will draw you closer together. Get a tattoo that both of you will enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>Wrists are quite commonplace to get a tattoo. Choosing a cute wrist tattoo will show your love and your connection with your sister.&nbsp; It can be a small tattoo or a good size tattoo like the photo above.&nbsp; This is sweet, cute, and innocent, showing two girls on swings that are sisters. &nbsp;As you can see in the photo, the two tattoos are the opposite of each other.&nbsp; Of course, when you get together, you have to take a photo like the one above to show off your matching tattoos!</p><p>Sisters may drive you crazy, get into your stuff and irritate you. However, if anyone else dares say so, a sister will defend you to the death.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/sister-tattoo/">Matching Tattoos</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Portrait Tattoo on Chest</strong></p><p>Portrait tattoos are an interesting form of body art as they feature beautiful portraits of people that not only look good but hold immense personal significance for the wearer. There can be various reasons as to why one might choose to wear a portrait tattoo. For many people, these tattoos serve as a sign of memorial for a loved one who has passed away. Some may also opt for these tattoos in order to show love and respect for a lover, a friend or one’s children. There are a number of ways in which these tattoos can be done.</p><p>A tattoo design featuring the headshot of an individual is the most common form of a portrait tattoo. These tattoos mostly lack a background, although that can be added if one wants to. The tattoo may also contain other details such as the name of the person portrayed in the design, the date of birth or the date of death. Other symbols that can be added to these tattoos include winged angels, praying hands or across.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">One great tattoo that you may want to consider is the portrait tattoo</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Portrait tattoos are a great way to give someone the appreciation and dedication that they deserve. Of course, portrait tattoos can be worn by all walks of life. Truth be told, there are a variety of reasons why men and women choose portrait tattoo designs. Portrait tattoo designs can also be designed in various ways other then a single portrait of someone.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">As mentioned above, there are many reasons why people will decide to choose a Portrait Tattoo on Chest</a></strong></p><p>One of the more common reasons that men and women choose portrait tattoos is for it to serve as a memorial or dedication tattoo. As we go through life, we lose those that are dear to our heart. Keeping their memory alive within us can be well represented with a tattoo. Many men and women choose portrait tattoos that will display their children. This is another popular reason why people choose portrait tattoos. You may just have a special person in mind that has been there through it all.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>History and Background</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">Lord Krishna</a>, the eighth avatar of God Vishnu is worshiped as a supreme God in Hinduism. Born in northern India (around 3,228 BCE), Lord Krishna’s life marks the passing of the Dvapara age and beginning of the Kal yuga (which is also considered as the current age).Krishna Tattoo</p><p>References to Lord Krishna can be found in several Hindu mythological books, especially in the epic Hindu book, the Mahabharata.</p><p>Lord Krishna is also described as an important figure in the Bhagavata Purana. This is another Hindu epic book that dates to the 10th century B.C. In the text, Lord Krishna is described as the charioteer for the warrior Arjuna who had guided him morally and gave military counsel to the leader.</p><p>There came a time when Mother Earth was unable to bear the sins and cruelty committed by evil kings and rulers. Mother Earth then prayed to Lord Brahma, the creator of the Universe, to relieve her from these sinful kings. Lord Brahma prayed to the supreme Lord Vishnu for reincarnation and to relieve the Mother Earth from these evil rulers. Lord Vishnu accepted the request and assured to defeat tyrannical forces.</p><p>The ruler of Mathura, Kansa was one such evil king. He had a sister named Devaki, who was married to Vasudeva. The day Devaki and Vasudeva got married, a voice from the sky forecasted that Devaki’s eighth son will bring an end to Kansa’s rule and will kill him.Krishna Tattoo</p><p>Frightened Kansa held the couple. He then vowed that he will kill every child of Devaki and Vasudeva. Seeing their first seven children being killed by the cruel Kansa, the imprisoned couple feared giving birth to their eighth child.</p><p><strong>One night Lord Vishnu appeared before them.</strong></p><p>He told them that in the guise of their son, he will return and rescue them from Kansa’s autocracy.</p><p>The divine baby was born and the day he was born, Vasudeva found himself magically freed from prison. He ran away with the infant to a safer house and Lord Vishnu removed all the obstacles from Vasudeva’s path.</p><p>Vasudeva reached a house in Gokul, exchanged Lord Krishna with a new born girl of Yashoda and Nanda and returned to the prison with the girl child. As soon as Kansa came to know about the new-born, he again tried to kill the child. The infant ascends to the heavens and transformed into the goddess Yogamaya and said, “O foolish Kansa! What will you get by killing me? Your nemesis is already born.”Krishna Tattoo</p><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">Krishna</a>&nbsp;was raised as a cowherd in Gokul and became a skilful musician. On his return to Mathura, he slayed Kansa and restored his father to power.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/krishna-tattoo-2/">Krishna Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can apply meanings to your<a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"> crown tattoo designs</a>. It is the symbolic symbol of many cultures. Some of the meanings of crown tattoos are: Power Authority Leadership</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Power</li><li>Authority</li><li>Leadership</li><li>Divine</li><li>inspiration</li><li>Justice</li><li>Legitimacy</li><li>Immortality</li><li>Good luck</li><li>Self-control</li><li>Importance</li><li>Control</li><li>ownership</li></ul><p>However, leadership, authority, and power are the most common meanings of crown tattoos. Mostly, a crown is designed with a bunch of different symbols. It symbolizes the importance of this symbol in the life of a person. This symbol can also represent your control over your own life.</p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">It can also represent your life</a> together and it is heading in the right direction. By portraying this symbol, some people like to reveal their control over their thoughts, actions, and feelings.</p><p>Therefore, it also represents ‘self-control.’ It reminds you to use your power justly. Many people abuse their power without thinking about the outcome of their words and actions. Because a crown tattoo can remind you to use your power and authority wisely and pure.</p><p><strong>Honor  </strong></p><p>Honor is something all royals strive for. It’s usually associated with heroic deeds, putting others first, and daring courage.&nbsp;</p><p>A crown and a quote is a great way to remind us to live honorably. Choose a short, meaningful phrase and place it on a ribbon curling around the crown for an amazing effect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Responsibility </strong></p><p>The crown comes with plenty of great things, but it‘s not so always an easy job wearing one.&nbsp;</p><p>This side of the emblem represents strength, kindness, and caring that needs to be extended to all people, especially when one is in a higher position.&nbsp;</p><p>An idea to show this in a tattoo design is to have a tattered or dirty headpiece, or perhaps half of it shiny and beautiful and half dirty and broken.&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/crown-tattoo/">Crown Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

When there is no mind then how can this ‘no-mindedness’ be expressed and how can anybody understand it? You need a little bit of the mind to understand, experience and to express.<br>The no-mind, infinite consciousness requires that little bit of mind to express itself in the manifest world. So, to express that inexpressible, that little mind (crescent moon) is on the head.<br>Wisdom is beyond the mind, but it needs to be expressed with a tinge of mind and this is symbolized by the crescent moon.</p><p id="block-35935c36-040e-4888-97dc-c01c27995fd9"><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">Significance of Lord Shiva’s Damru</a></strong></p><p id="block-eda7bd1d-dcde-45e8-8352-34867d10d2bb"><strong>Damru</strong> symbolizes the Universe which is always expanding and collapsing. From an expansion, it collapses and then it re-expands, this is the process of creation.<br>If you see your heartbeat, it is not just one straight line but it is a rhythm that goes up and down. The whole world is nothing but rhythms; energy rising and collapsing to rise again. So the damru signifies that. Look at the shape of the damru, from expansion it collapses and again expands.</p><p id="block-ca58784e-6ebf-455b-89c2-00cab901d6bb">The&nbsp;darmru&nbsp;is also a symbol of sound. Sound is rhythm and sound is energy. The whole universe is nothing but a wave function, it is nothing but rhythms. What does quantum physics say? It says the same thing – the whole universe is nothing but rhythms. It is just one wave (Adviata). So the&nbsp;damru&nbsp;signifies the non-dual nature of the universe.</p><p id="block-0dfd93d1-01c7-4e3a-a2a9-d5622f1aa035">Shiva Tattoo &#8211; <strong>Significance of Serpent around Lord Shiva’s Neck</strong></p><p id="block-8c73cd79-509d-4d92-b35b-4cc78918c6fc">A state of samadhi where there is nothing, just the inner sky of consciousness, is Shiva; where there is alertness and no action. To describe this alertness they put a snake around Shiva’s neck. So the&nbsp;<strong>serpent</strong>&nbsp;is a symbol of&nbsp;<strong>alertness</strong>.</p><p id="block-5c906d6c-46b2-43d3-8a88-26c329dda3ef">In the state of meditation when the eyes are closed, it gives the impression that the person is sleeping, but he is not asleep, he is alert. To express this state of consciousness, a&nbsp;<strong>snake</strong>&nbsp;is shown around Lord Shiva’s neck.</p><p id="block-96495130-28ba-4eef-b235-a8224eca34f7"><strong>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Trishul (Trident)</strong>-Shiva Tattoo</p><p id="block-0515e0d6-5817-47e1-9cf5-a9d6141e24ee"><strong>Trishul</strong> represents the three aspects of consciousness – waking, dreaming, and sleeping, and it represents the three Gunas – satva, rajas, and tamas. Holding a Trishul (Trident) signifies that Shiva (the divinity) is above all the three states – waking, dreaming and sleeping, yet is the upholder of these three states.<br>The divinity is beyond the three Gunas, but it holds the three Gunas together.</p><p id="block-2948c12d-de54-4f4c-ab7e-619d00cc8c36"><strong>Shul</strong> means problems or suffering. <strong>Trishul</strong> means that which destroys all kinds of suffering.</p><p id="block-2948c12d-de54-4f4c-ab7e-619d00cc8c36"><strong>Three types of pain that arise in life:</strong></p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Aadibhautik (physical)</li><li>Aadhyaatmik (spiritual) and</li><li>Aadidaivik (ethereal)</li></ol><p id="block-2948c12d-de54-4f4c-ab7e-619d00cc8c36">What relieves you from all the problems and suffering is the Trishul. And it is in the hand of Shiva.</p><p>View all <a href="/portfolio_category/lord-shiva-tattoos/">Shiva Tattoos</a>.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/shiva-tattoo/">Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Creation of Adam&nbsp;is a&nbsp;fresco&nbsp;painting by Italian artist&nbsp;Michelangelo, which forms part of the&nbsp;Sistine Chapel&#8217;s ceiling.</p><p>It illustrates the&nbsp;Biblical&nbsp;creation narrative&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Book of Genesis&nbsp;in which&nbsp;God&nbsp;gives life to&nbsp;Adam. The fresco is part of a complex iconographic scheme and is chronologically the fourth in the series of panels depicting episodes from Genesis.</p><p>The image of the near-touching hands of God and Adam has become iconic of&nbsp;humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Michelangelo&#8217;s&nbsp;<em>Creation of Adam</em>&nbsp;is one of the most replicated religious paintings of all time.</p><p>During the same period, <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">Michelangelo</a> painted the ceiling of the <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">Sistine Chape</a>l. Which took approximately four years to complete (1508–1512).&#8221;The Hand of God&#8221; is perhaps the most enduring of Michelangelo&#8217;s paintings. Almost five centuries later this image remains prevalent and is still being used in advertising and on posters and T-shirts.This is particularly true of the detail that shows the two hands as they reach towards each other, tantalizingly close, almost touching.The panel illustrates the moment when life is instilled in Adam by God. Michelangelo has placed the central focus upon the hands of God and of Adam, not just by the placement of the figures, but also by the two outstretched arms.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">hand is limp</a>, the fingers are drooping as if they are without energy, awaiting the vital spark of life.</p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/creation-of-adam-tattoo/"><strong>Creation of Adam Tattoo</strong></a></p><p>One of the questions that has been raised about this scene is the identity of the figures next to God.&nbsp; Given her privileged placement under the arm of God, the female figure is presumably an important one.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/creation-of-adam-tattoo/">Creation of Adam Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>collarbone tattoo A rose tattoo is one of the most prevalent patterns in the world. Both males and females embellish their bodies with this symbol, which has a very deep and complicated history.</p><p>Originally, this pattern has appeared in Persia, there a rose was considered to be only a male flower, but then diverse senses have been assigned to this pattern in divergent countries.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><p>Thus, for instance, in Greece this flower symbolized the blood of Aphrodite, in Rome it has been connected with the goddess Diana, who has transformed her lover into a rose, in Egypt it was a favorite flower of Isis, in Christian countries the rose has been associated with the blood of Christ.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>THE MEANING OF THE OM SYMBOL </strong></p><p>‘Om’,&nbsp;‘Ohm’&nbsp;or&nbsp;‘Aum’&nbsp;is a sacred sound that is known generally, as the sound of the universe. Om is all encompassing, the essence of ultimate reality, and unifies everything in the universe. The vibrations that the Om sound creates are thought to energize, the chakras throughout the body.</p><p>Especially the third eye and crown chakras, which help us connect with our Divine selves.which is chanted to connect with and energize the chakras. </p><p>The Om symbol represents the sound in a visual form and has a lot of meaning behind it. </p><p>Om is one of the most important spiritual symbols and is found throughout many ancient Hindu texts, prayers and ceremonies.</p><p><strong>Elements of the Om Symbol</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The&nbsp;Om symbol is a combination of curves, a crescent and a dot. The meaning of the Om symbol, while purely looking at its visual form, the states of consciousness that&nbsp;Aum&nbsp;represents. The letter &#8216;A&#8217;&nbsp;represents the&nbsp;waking state, &#8216;U&#8217; represents the dream state and &#8216;M&#8217; is the unconscious state, or state of deep sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the symbol, the waking state is represented by the bottom curve.The dream state is the middle curve and the state of deep sleep is represented with the upper curve. </p><p>Om Shiva Tattoo, The crescent shape above the curves denotes Maya, or Illusion. Which is the obstacle that sits in the way of reaching the highest state of bliss. </p><p> The dot at the top of the symbol represents the absolute state. Which is the fourth state of consciousness and is absolute peace and bliss. This fourth state is believed to be the state in which someone could truly connect with the Divine.</p><p><strong>Who is Shiva?</strong></p><p>Shiva is the third god in the Hindu triumvirate. Om Shiva Tattoo, The triumvirate consists of three gods who are responsible for the creation, upkeep and destruction of the world. The other two gods are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/deities/brahma.shtml">Brahma</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/deities/vishnu.shtml">Vishnu</a>.</p><p>Brahma is the creator of the universe while Vishnu is the preserver of it. Shiva&#8217;s role is to destroy the universe in order to re-create it.</p><p>Hindus believe his powers of destruction and recreation are used even now to destroy the illusions and imperfections of this world, paving the way for beneficial change. According to Hindu belief, this destruction is not arbitrary, but constructive. Shiva is therefore seen as the source of both good and evil and is regarded as the one who combines many contradictory elements.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/om-shiva-tattoo/">Om Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cherry Blossom Flower Tattoo, The Japanese cherry blossom is interpreted as ‘transient of life’, since it is very fragile and has a short blooming period. There is an old story attached to this tree that values sacrifice. It is said that there is a&nbsp;<em>Jiu-roku-zakura</em>(the Cherry tree of the Sixteenth day), in the Iyo district of the country. This tree grew on the lands of a Samurai for over a hundred years. </p><p><strong>Cherry Blossom Flower Tattoo </strong></p><p>When the Samurai became old, the tree began to die. <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/513128951289253380/?nic=1">https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/513128951289253380/?nic=1</a>The Samurai felt really bad for the tree. He was a brave and honorable man. Hence, he thought up of a way to save the tree’s life.</p><p>He sat under the tree and committed a ritual suicide right there. This act gave the essence of the Samurai’s life to the tree. Within one hour of the Samurai’s death, on the 16th day of the month. The tree began to blossom and continues to live even today. Hence, the cherry blossom tree harbors many spiritual beliefs. These beliefs are set deep within the fundamental teachings of the Buddha.</p><p>More popularly known in Asian cultures such as in Japan, cherry blossoms have various meanings. They have become a national symbol for the country and they have been known to be celebrating amazing cherry blossom festivals all throughout spring. Not only does the flower have national symbolism it also has cultural impact as well. Primarily it is believed to be a symbol of joy and love; it also helps strengthen the spirit and promotes the beauty of life. Cherry blossoms only bloom in spring and they disappear again after a short time which symbolizes how people should value and appreciate life as it lasts.</p><p>Cherries can be divided into three groups &#8211; the&nbsp;<em>European, the American, and the Oriental</em>. In general, the Oriental types (Prunus serrulata) are less hardy. This genus &#8211; Prunus comprises over 400 species and numerous cultivars of trees and shrubs growing in temperate climates mostly in the Northern Hemisphere.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/cherry-blossom-flower-tattoo/">Cherry Blossom Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>“There have been very few who have been able to rejoice both in victory and in defeat,”</strong></p><p>Amma says. “Sri Krishna is one who celebrated both life and death. That is why he was always able to give a big smile.He took birth with a smile on his face, lived with a smile, and left his body with a smile. The message that he conveyed through his life is that we should make life full of laughter.”</p><p><strong>krishna tattoo</strong> </p><p>Krishna’s life was so full, it would be impossible to recount it all here. It is told primarily through Srimad Bhagavatam, Garga Samhita, Visnu Purana, Brahmavaivarta Purana, Mahabharata, Harivamsa and several other Puranas. However, here are some of the broad strokes.</p><p>Krishna, in fact, took birth in a prison cell. A sage had told his egoistic uncle, King Kamsa, that he would be killed by his sister Devaki’s child. So Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and had each child she bore murdered. However, Devaki, and her husband, Vasudeva, finally were able to sneak one child off to safety. This was Sri Krishna. They sent Krishna off to Vraja, where he was raised by a foster mother, Yasoda. It was in Vrindavan, one of the villages of Vraja, that Krishna won the hearts of the gopis, the cowherds of the village. “By spending all his time with the gopis of Vrindavan—playing with them, joking with them, stealing their butter and milk, etc—what he actually was doing was stealing their hearts,” Amma says. It is from this that Krishna was given the name “Chitta Chora” [one who steals the mind].</p><p><strong>Sri Krishna at Dwarka</strong></p><p>krishna tattoo, In later life, Sri Krishna retired to Dwarka where he lived for many years. Legend has it that Sri Krishna was killed by an arrow through his ankle when he was shot by a hunter, who mistook Sri Krishna for a deer. The ankle was the one area of weakness in Sri Krishna’s body. He accepted death calmly, knowing his time on earth and come to an end.<a href="//www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/513128951289262457/?nic=1">//www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/513128951289262457/?nic=1</a></p><p><br></p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/krishna-tattoo/">Krishna Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The compass tattoo has been a popular choice among a majority of cultures for centuries. This maritime symbol was popular among early sailors. Getting a compass tattoo would protect them. On rough waters and ensure that you would return home safely.</p><p>One of the main reasons sailors opted for this tattoo was that of protection. As a token of good luck, images of compasses painted on the ships as well. The seas were rough and unforgiving. Often times ships and the men onboard would disappear without a trace so these images served as a beacon of hope that they would be guided out of the treacherous waters alive.</p><p>Compass tattoos can come in a variety of styles and variations. These include,&nbsp;star compass, astrocompass, lodestone compass, Vegvisir compass and prismatic compass.</p><p><strong>The star compass is the most popular of the aforementioned designs and is said to represent the North Star.</strong></p><p>Before maps and technology existed, humans used the North Star to guide them in the right direction. Because of this, this style of tattoo stands for guidance, direction and finding a way home.</p><p>A way of depicting this is to include an image of a clock or hourglass with the compass in the tattoo design. Maps and earth play a role as well as maps, like compasses, help a user determine their location.</p><p>Compass tattoos have also represented the ideal of following one’s dreams. It is symbolic of staying your course in life and to not give up no matter how rough things may seem.</p><p>The compass will guide you where you need to be.</p><p>Overall, this type of tattoo conveys guidance and direction, but you may add additional design elements to your tattoo to have it depict a meaning that is significant to you.</p><p>#compasstattoo #ClockAndCompassTattoo #Compass #tattoo #tattoos #girlswithtattoos #tattooed #tattooartist #tattooart #tattooedgirls #guyswithtattoos #instatattoo #tattoolife #tattoodesign #traditionaltattoo #tattooflash #tattooist #tattoogirl #handtattoo #tattooedgirl #sleevetattoo #tattooing #tattooshop #blacktattoo #chesttattoo #tattoosofinstagram #rosetattoo #blackandgreytattoo #tattoomodel #tattooer #colortattoo</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/nautical-star-compass-tattoo-2/">Anchor Compass Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A roaring lion is an animal to be respected and feared. It is a symbol of Power and Authority and a sign that you aren&#8217;t a person to be taken lightly. Roaring lions are born leaders, gifted fighters, and, in a crunch, are the persons who can best guide the group out of danger.&nbsp;<span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s1">t</span><span class="s1">he tradition</span>, a lion whelp was still-born but brought to life by the roar of his father. The whelp later went on to create and lead the tribes of Israel. The symbolism shows that the word of the Divine (represented by the roaring Lion) has the power to breathe life into weakest being (the whelp) and transform him into a force to be reckoned with. A Roaring Lion Tattoo expresses to the world that you aren&#8217;t a pushover and that a beast lies underneath the surface, primed and ready to strike.</p><p>Aside from the basic verbal symbolism of the lion, there are some deeper meanings connected to them as well.</p><p>Lion tattoos have been placed on men throughout history. Those in Asia, Africa, India and the Middle East have put great emphasis on the lion tattoo for many centuries. Lions have always known as the king of the jungle and this status portrays great power. I think this has always been the big draw about the lion tattoo. If you think about it, the lion can also be a symbol of a religious nature. King of the Jungle – King of Kings.</p><p><b>Ancient Civilizations</b></p><p>The lion has been portrayed for many years in ancient cultures, legends, mythology, astrology, literature, movies, and much more. In a few ancient civilizations, lions were owned by kings and royalty. The lion was a symbol of power to the people of the king&#8217;s&nbsp;power&nbsp;and&nbsp;strength. In an interesting contrast, in Roman mythology, the lion is associated with&nbsp;love.</p><p>The lion was also symbolic to the Egyptians they often portrayed two lions with their backs to one another. These statues represented&nbsp;balance, which was very important to the Egyptians. They would usually place these statues outside of sacred structures. The Egyptians believed in balance, such as sunrise sunset and east-west their lion statues represented this all-important balance.</p><p><strong>Religion</strong></p><p>The lion is also a symbol of Christianity. Some Christians use the lion tattoo to symbolize Christian beliefs. The lion is also a symbolic figure to Islam, in which the lion and the sword represent power. The lion is also a solar animal. This means that the lion has sun-like qualities and characteristics. In many culture and beliefs, the lion is associated with the sun. It is said that the the lion&#8217;s mane looks like the rays of the sun—a trait that many tattoos often highlight. In other ancient myths, the lion represents the&nbsp;transformation&nbsp;and journey from childhood to adulthood.</p><p><strong>Culture</strong></p><p>The lion is also very symbolic to the Chinese. It represents a symbol of good luck,&nbsp;guardianship, and power. The Chinese also believe that the lion is a symbol of the earth and sun. Many people know that the lion &#8220;Leo&#8221; is part of the Zodiac. Leo is the 5th sign of the Zodiac, and anyone born between July 23-August 22 is considered to be a Leo. People born during this time are very highly energetic and are good hearted people. The Leo is somewhat timid and enjoys control, but they are very generous. The Leo also represents balance.</p><p>As you now know, the lion has been portrayed throughout human history and they have been symbolic figures for many years. It is one of the most symbolic animal tattoos that are available. Due to all the different meanings it holds, it is highly sought after in the tattoo world. There are also a variety of different designs and styles for it as well. There are tribal designs and Celtic designs, and many more. Before choosing a final design, make sure you check out every style and design that is available. Make sure you choose a design that you are satisfied with.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/lion-tattoo-on-arm/">Lion Tattoo on Arm</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

It was the only symbol that could depict both the past and the present at the same time, so it came to represent both life and death. Its sands would flow regardless of the elements around it—just as a person’s life winds down at a steady pace, regardless of their good or bad deeds—so it was also used to instill a fear of death into people. Pirates adopted it for their flags, and people still place it on gravestones and coffins.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/hourglass-tattoo/">Hourglass Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="ctl01_mainContent_39661"><strong>The Five Eternal Elements</strong></p><p>When Bhagwan Swaminarayan set out on His spiritual journey at eleven years of age, He halted only after getting a reply to the question He had asked all across India. On His quest, He asked about the five eternal elements as revealed in the Vedas. He found a reasonable answer in Loj from Ramananad Swami’s chief disciple, Muktanand Swami. He accepted Ramanand Swami as His guru and then established the Swaminarayan Sampraday in Gujarat. Bhagwan Swaminarayan describes these five eternal elements and their relationship in great detail throughout the Vachanamrut.</p><p><strong>Pramukh Swami Tattoo These five eternal elements are: Jiva, Ishwar, Maya, Brahma, and Parabrahma. </strong></p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl07_divpagercontrol"><strong>Jiva &#8211; The Soul</strong></p><p>One&#8217;s true identity is not this human body, but the jiva that resides within it.&nbsp;The jiva, also called &#8216;atma&#8217; or soul, is eternal &#8211; it cannot be destroyed. The jiva has no gender; it is neither male nor female.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan discusses the nature of the jiva throughout the Vachanamrut.&nbsp;It is said to reside in our bodies in the same area as the heart.&nbsp;“Childhood, youth, old age, stoutness, thinness, birth and death are all aspects of the body.</p><p>On the other hand, being uncuttable, being unpierceable, not aging, being immortal, being the embodiment of gnan [wisdom], being the embodiment of bliss, and being characterized by eternal existence are all aspects of the atma; they should in no way be considered as belonging to the body.” The jiva is free and pure, but we believe that we are restrained by maya. Once we understand that we are not this body and worship Purna Purushottam Narayan, we realize that our jiva is free from the clutches of maya and is worthy of moksha. The very essence of the Brahma-Parabrahma spiritual journey is to believe one’s self to be the atma and not this body, to become atmarup, and to worship Purna Purshottam Narayan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ishwar &#8211; Divinities</strong></p><p>Ishwar transcends the jiva. It is the next element above the jiva.&nbsp;These beings partake in the creation, sustenance, and destruction of each universe.&nbsp;Ishwars are conscious spiritual beings that have greater realization than jivas.</p><p>While the jiva must work to realize its divine presence within the human body, ishwar is aware of that divinity. There are infinite ishwars, and but they are all bound by maya. Just as Purna Purshottam Narayan controls the jiva, He also controls the ishwars. Like the jivas, ishwars too aim to surpass maya and attain moksha.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl09_divpagercontrol"><strong>Maya &#8211; Ignorance</strong></p><p>Maya is the ignorance that separates the jivas and ishwars from Brahma and Parabrahma. It is the desire that hinders a spiritual aspirant’s path to moksha. Maya directly translates to attachment for worldly objects. Maya is the instrument through which Parabrahma facilitates karma and moksha. Only when a devotee is able to overcome maya overcome the darkness of attachment to worldly objects is he or she able to attain moksha. Maya manifests from physical matter, and it is difficult for the jiva or ishwar to transcend. Bhagwan Swaminarayan has advocated the jiva to engage in constant bhakti or devotion to God. To move beyond maya and towards one&#8217;s liberation.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl10_divpagercontrol"><strong>Aksharbrahma &#8211; The Eternal Abode</strong></p><p>The gunatit sadhu, Aksharbrahma, is the pathway to God and to moksha. It is only through Aksharbrahma that a jiva can associate itself with God and understand Him well enough to seek complete refuge in Him, thereby bringing the jiva out of the darkness of maya and into the light of Parabrahma. IParabrahma &#8211; GodIn the Vachanamrut, Bhagwan Swaminarayan has described this Supreme God as all-knowing, all-powerful and yet compassionate. This Parabrahma governs all the other four elements of jiva, ishwar, maya and brahma. Swaminarayan devotees believe Bhagwan Swaminarayan to be Parabrahma.&nbsp;In the Vibhuti Yoga Adhyaya of the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, Shri Krishna speaks of that Supreme God living and working through him.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan in the Vachanamrut says that Purna Purushottam Narayan resides in Akshardham and visits this Earth to establish dharma for the sake of His devotees. He is always present in human form (pragat).&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/pramukh-swami-tattoo/">Pramukh Swami Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us have owned or seen diamonds at some point. When we think about them, we often think about wealth, luxury and fashion, even the higher quality of one&#8217;s life. Some people wear diamonds on their ring fingers while others wear them on their skin, having a micro dermally implanted diamond. Diamonds have decorated all types of ancient and royal crowns and are called a &#8220;<i>girl&#8217;s best friend.</i>&#8220;</p><p><b>History:</b>&nbsp;The word &#8220;diamond&#8221; is Greek in origin (<span class="s1">ἀ</span>δάμας–<i>adámas</i>&nbsp;or &#8220;unbreakable&#8221;) and means strength and invincibility. They are made of a nearly indestructible mineral, created deep in the earth by massive pressure weighing down on carbon deposits and then brought up to the earth&#8217;s surface via volcanic eruptions. One of the earliest recorded accounts of diamonds was from India around 400 BC. Today, most come from Africa.</p><p><b>Beauty:</b>&nbsp;You&#8217;ll find diamonds in fashion magazines and on any red carpet or runway. There are sayings that equate these gems with inner beauty (like a &#8220;diamond in the rough&#8221;). which is apt, since they appear rough on the outside when first mined, but once they are polished, their beauty is revealed. To the tattoo wearer, the diamond may represent inner beauty, as in the saying, &#8220;true beauty is found on the inside.&#8221;</p><p><b>Power:</b>&nbsp;We often associate diamonds with wealth and the power that money can bring. The gem is very expensive and multiple diamonds may represent great wealth and value. They are extremely coveted items and some people will do anything to get their hands on them.</p><p><b>Words about Diamonds:</b>&nbsp;As I stated earlier, some tattoos incorporate famous quotes or personal words to underline and accentuate the meaning of the tattoo. These quotes may be placed on ribbons or&nbsp;<span class="s2">banners</span>&nbsp;or inked inside or outside the diamond design. Another popular thing that people do is have the first letter of their own name. The name of a loved one inked inside the diamond.</p><p><b>Diamond as a Birthstone:</b>&nbsp;People born in April claim the diamond as their birthstone. A tattoo may be used to represent the month a person was born. Since diamonds are associated with the month of April. The gem might be used as a symbolic representation of anything or anyone that began that month.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/diamond-wings-tattoo/">Diamond Wings Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mahamrityunjaya Mantra is one among the oldest and most important Mantra in Indian mythology and spirituality. This mantra belongs to Lord Shiva. It is a combination of three Hindi language words i.e. ‘Maha’, which means great, ‘Mrityun’ means death and ‘Jaya’ means victory, which turns into conqueror victory over death.It is also known as ‘Rudra Mantra’ or ‘Trayambakam Mantra’. The Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra is said to have been created by Rishi Markandeya. The Moon was once in trouble, cursed by King Daksha. Rishi Markandeya gave the Mahamritryunjaya Mantra to Sati, Daksha&#8217;s daughter, for the Moon.</p><p><strong>Lord Shiva Mantra Tattoo</strong></p><p><strong>Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra Tattoo</strong></p><p><span class="s1">त्रयम्बकं</span> <span class="s1">यजामहे</span> <span class="s1">सुगन्धिं</span> <span class="s1">पुष्टिवर्धनम्</span> <span class="s2">।</span> <span class="s1">उर्वारुकमिव</span> <span class="s1">बन्धनान्</span> <span class="s1">म्रुत्योर्मुक्षिय</span> <span class="s1">मामृतात्</span> <span class="s2">॥</span> Om Trayambakam Yajamahe, Sugandhim Pushti Vardhanam, Urvarukmiv Bandhanat, Mrityurmokshaya Mamratat.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feathers are generally a very beautiful and gentle tattoo designs. Lots of girls and guys choose peacock feather simply because it is more beautiful than other feathers, while only a small number associates the feather to the meaning of peacock tattoos.</p><p>Feathers symbolize creativity, spiritual evaluation, and rebirth. Most common places for a peacock feather are ribs, scapulas or a side of the lower back. Peacock feather should, by all means, be done in full color – it is the colors that make it so beautiful.</p><p>Within the design of the peacock feather is what appears to be an eye, and that is part of the reason the peacock is also known as the bird of 100 eyes. The reference is directly related to the pattern of the eye that appears in its feathers, and these little birds are also thought to be all-seeing.</p><p><strong>Peacock Feather Tattoo</strong></p><p>Peacock feathers, or mor pankh, are regarded as an auspicious symbol in Hindu mythology because of their association with the peacock, a beautiful bird which is also the national bird of India. You may have noticed that many people keep peacock feathers in their homes. It is believed that keeping peacock feathers at home brings good luck and prosperity into the house.</p><p>This design today is symbolic of a person who has an open mind, someone who sees the world with both their eyes open, or someone that is definitely not afraid of the challenges that lie ahead.</p><p>Peacock feather tattoo could indicate a very proud person. It could be comprehended in two ways. The person wearing it could either be very proud of herself for good reasons or simply very arrogant.</p><p><b>The&nbsp;Meaning&nbsp;of Ganesh</b></p><p><b>Gan<i>&nbsp;</i></b>means group. A universe is a group of atoms and different energies. This universe would be in chaos if there was no supreme law governing these diverse groups of entities.<br><b>The Lord of all these groups of atoms and energies is&nbsp;</b><strong>Ganesha</strong><b>.&nbsp;</b></p><p>He is the supreme consciousness that pervades all and brings order in this universe.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/peacock-feather-flute-tattoo/">Peacock Feather with Flute Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Infinity tattoos are steadily on the rise with many people opting to get these in one form or another.</strong></p><p>The <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">infinity</a> symbol, often used in mathematics, represents a never-ending loop and is depicted as a number 8 on its side. In the tattoo world, this can be seen as a symbol of never-ending or limitless possibility. Some cultures also believe it to represent rebirth or reincarnation.</p><p>Historically, this symbol is similar to mythological creatures such as Ouroboros; the snake which consumed its tail and became a creature without end. Often when people get their infinity tattoo, for this reason, they are showing that they are both into mythology and that they like the creatures that the symbol represents. These aren’t the deepest meanings for the infinity tattoo, but they can always attach more meanings to the design later on.</p><p><strong>The endless loops and circles that comprise the infinity symbol can also be likened to the seasonal cycle which endlessly repeats year after year.</strong></p><p>In this way, the infinity tattoo could mean that the person wants to keep their eye on the ball no matter what time of year it is. It could also mean that they don’t necessarily have a favorite season. But instead choose to enjoy their lives regardless of the time of year it currently is.</p><p>These <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">infinity tattoos</a>, while simple, can be customized in a variety of ways.</p><p>Popular choices for this type of tattoo include a word or phrase. Inside the loop, such as “love”, “life” or “friendship”.</p><p>These, of course, signify a relationship that will never end. And are often used as matching tattoos for two or more people.</p><p>One can even add additional symbols such a hearts, stars or other embellishments. To add to the flair of the design.</p><p>The fact is that the infinity symbol itself is a bit bland unless holds a lot of meaning to you.</p><p>so many people decide to surround it with other images that make the meaning come to life a bit more.</p><p>As always, it comes down to the tastes of the person getting the infinity tattoo.</p><p>If they are able to find a design that works well with the infinity symbol.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/infinity-sign-tattoo/">Infinity Sign Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Someone rightly said once that God could not be anywhere and that is why he created mothers.</strong></p><p>Mothers are truly special and one can never do enough to show them just how much they are loved and appreciated.&nbsp;Nothing speaks better than a permanent tattoo. Tattoos are like preserving and expressing love for as long as you are alive. Mothers and special and so they deserve a special place in your life and what better way than to keep her with you forever on a part of you. It is nothing but a sign of truly unbreakable bond.</p><p>Mothers expect nothing but unconditional love and support from her children and what better way to show her that with a simple but beautiful tattoo. Some mothers definitely do not want to see their children going through pain and getting a permanent tattoo is a little painful but if she sees that you went through that pain just because you love her, she would surely grow bigger with love.</p><p><strong>Maa Tattoo,  don’t require words as they are a language on their own.</strong></p><p>Today mother and daughter even get matching tattoos which are not only adorable but make other mother-daughter pairs envious. Sharing a common tattoo is a lot more personal and deep than just doing something together.</p><p>Mothers daughters and grandmothers nowadays have matching tattoos and this concept of generation tattoos is beautiful. Tattoos don’t have to be large and colorful to convey feelings. Even a small, sweet tattoo is enough to show love and gratitude. You can get a tattoo for your mom or with your mom to establish bond just as deep as blood bond. In case of mom tattoos or mother daughter tattoos, less is definitely more. No one else deserves a place on your body more than your mother because she kept you in her womb for nine months. She nurtured you and cared for you not because she had any selfish interests but because she loves you with all her heart.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/maa-tattoo/">Maa Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Lion Tattoo</b></p><p><b>Roaring Lion Tattoo</b></p><p>A roaring lion is an animal to be respected and feared. It is a symbol of Power and Authority and a sign that you aren&#8217;t a person to be taken lightly. Roaring lions are born leaders, gifted fighters, and, in a crunch, are the persons who can best guide the group out of danger.&nbsp;<span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s1">t</span><span class="s1">he tradition</span>, a lion whelp was still-born but brought to life by the roar of his father. The whelp later went on to create and lead the tribes of Israel. The symbolism shows that the word of the Divine (represented by the roaring Lion) has the power to breathe life into weakest being (the whelp) and transform him into a force to be reckoned with. A Roaring Lion Tattoo expresses to the world that you aren&#8217;t a pushover and that a beast lies underneath the surface, primed and ready to strike.</p><p>Aside from the basic verbal symbolism of the lion, there are some deeper meanings connected to them as well.</p><p>Lion tattoos have been placed on men throughout history. Those in Asia, Africa, India and the Middle East have put great emphasis on the lion tattoo for many centuries. Lions have always known as the king of the jungle and this status portrays great power. I think this has always been the big draw about the lion tattoo. If you think about it, the lion can also be a symbol of a religious nature. King of the Jungle – King of Kings.</p><p><b>Ancient Civilizations</b></p><p>The lion has been portrayed for many years in ancient cultures, legends, mythology, astrology, literature, movies, and much more. In a few ancient civilizations, lions were owned by kings and royalty. The lion was a symbol of power to the people of the king&#8217;s&nbsp;power&nbsp;and&nbsp;strength. In an interesting contrast, in Roman mythology, the lion is associated with&nbsp;love.</p><p>The lion was also symbolic to the Egyptians they often portrayed two lions with their backs to one another. These statues represented&nbsp;balance, which was very important to the Egyptians. They would usually place these statues outside of sacred structures. The Egyptians believed in balance, such as sunrise sunset and east west their lion statues represented this all important balance.</p><p><strong>Religion</strong></p><p>The lion is also a symbol of Christianity. Some Christians use the lion tattoo to symbolize Christian beliefs. The lion is also a symbolic figure to Islam, in which the lion and the sword represent power. The lion is also a solar animal. This means that the lion has sun-like qualities and characteristics. In many culture and beliefs, the lion is associated with the sun. It is said that the the lion&#8217;s mane looks like the rays of the sun—a trait that many tattoos often highlight. In other ancient myths, the lion represents the&nbsp;transformation&nbsp;and journey from childhood to adulthood.</p><p><strong>Culture</strong></p><p>The lion is also very symbolic to the Chinese. It represents a symbol of good luck,&nbsp;guardianship, and power. The Chinese also believe that the lion is a symbol of the earth and sun. Many people know that the lion &#8220;Leo&#8221; is part of the Zodiac. Leo is the 5th sign of the Zodiac, and anyone born between July 23-August 22 is considered to be a Leo. People born during this time are very highly energetic and are good hearted people. The Leo is somewhat timid and enjoys control, but they are very generous. The Leo also represents balance.</p><p>As you now know, the lion has been portrayed throughout human history and they have been symbolic figures for many years. It is one of the most symbolic animal tattoos that are available. Due to all the different meanings it holds, it is highly sought after in the tattoo world. There are also a variety of different designs and styles for it as well. There are tribal designs and Celtic designs, and many more. Before choosing a final design, make sure you check out every style and design that is available. Make sure you choose a design that you are satisfied with.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/roaring-lion-tattoo-2/">Roaring Lion Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
