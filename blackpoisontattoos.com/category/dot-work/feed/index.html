										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The compass tattoo has been a popular choice among a majority of cultures for centuries. This maritime symbol was popular among early sailors. Getting a compass tattoo would protect them. On rough waters and ensure that you would return home safely.</p><p>One of the main reasons sailors opted for this tattoo was that of protection. As a token of good luck, images of compasses painted on the ships as well. The seas were rough and unforgiving. Often times ships and the men onboard would disappear without a trace so these images served as a beacon of hope that they would be guided out of the treacherous waters alive.</p><p>Compass tattoos can come in a variety of styles and variations. These include,&nbsp;star compass, astrocompass, lodestone compass, Vegvisir compass and prismatic compass.</p><p><strong>The star compass is the most popular of the aforementioned designs and is said to represent the North Star.</strong></p><p>Before maps and technology existed, humans used the North Star to guide them in the right direction. Because of this, this style of tattoo stands for guidance, direction and finding a way home.</p><p>A way of depicting this is to include an image of a clock or hourglass with the compass in the tattoo design. Maps and earth play a role as well as maps, like compasses, help a user determine their location.</p><p>Compass tattoos have also represented the ideal of following one’s dreams. It is symbolic of staying your course in life and to not give up no matter how rough things may seem.</p><p>The compass will guide you where you need to be.</p><p>Overall, this type of tattoo conveys guidance and direction, but you may add additional design elements to your tattoo to have it depict a meaning that is significant to you.</p><p>#compasstattoo #ClockAndCompassTattoo #Compass #tattoo #tattoos #girlswithtattoos #tattooed #tattooartist #tattooart #tattooedgirls #guyswithtattoos #instatattoo #tattoolife #tattoodesign #traditionaltattoo #tattooflash #tattooist #tattoogirl #handtattoo #tattooedgirl #sleevetattoo #tattooing #tattooshop #blacktattoo #chesttattoo #tattoosofinstagram #rosetattoo #blackandgreytattoo #tattoomodel #tattooer #colortattoo</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/nautical-star-compass-tattoo-2/">Anchor Compass Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beetles have also caught the eye, and prayers, of those people seeking Divine intervention. By far, the most well-known beetle to grace the surface of religious artifacts is the Scarab Beetle. Known as&nbsp;<em>&#8216;The Creator&#8217;</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>&#8216;The Khepri&#8217;</em>&nbsp;in ancient Egypt, Scarab Beetles were believed to be a representation of the Sun God and the way they rolled their dung ball across the hot desert sands was said to be a cosmic re-enactment of the ancient Sun god,&nbsp;Atum, pushing the sun across the vast sky.</p><p>The Egyptian name for the Scarab Beetle (Kheper) translates into&nbsp;<em>&#8216;to come into existence and transform&#8217;</em>and their connection with the Divine accounts for why important Egyptians like pharaohs and noblemen were buried lots of Scarab Beetles and their tomb walls were filled with images of the insect in its spiritual quest to&nbsp;<em>&#8216;push the Sun across the sky&#8217;</em>.</p><p><strong>Bejeweled Scarabs were wrapped in the mummified pharaoh&#8217;s bandages in the belief that this would help him to reawaken in the land of the Dead and start his journey towards resurrection.</strong></p><p>Outside of the Egyptian spiritual realm, beetles became renowned as signs of good fortune. Ladybugs are common characters in children&#8217;s stories and play. Many non-profits that promote tolerance and peace use the image of an adorable Ladybug to easily convey their message. Who knows, it might bring your soul mate to you.</p><p><strong>The Meaning of Beetle Tattoo Designs</strong></p><p>The types of&nbsp;beetles&nbsp;on the face of the Earth are as numerous as the amount of sand on a beach. These include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Nobility</li><li>The Divine</li><li>Luck</li><li>Love</li><li>Prosperity and Abundance</li><li>Strength</li><li>Creation and Immortality</li><li>Organization and Discipline</li></ul><p><strong>Beetel-tattoo Design Variations</strong></p><p><strong>From the delicate contours and vibrant colors of the Ladybug to the strong outline of the Scarab Beetle, these tattoos come in all colors and sizes.</strong></p><p>Whether or not you add other elements to your design depends largely on the type of beetle you want to on your body.</p><p><strong>Scarab Beetle Tattoos</strong><br>
It&#8217;s hard to picture ancient Egypt and the famous tombs of her pharaohs. Without the iconic image of the Scarab Beetle. From tomb walls and chariots to official seals, the Scarab Beetle was a reminder of the pharaoh&#8217;s divine power to the ordinary citizens. Scarab Beetles are totems of&nbsp;Atum, the creator god and represent a connection to the powerful forces of Creation, Renewal, and Transformation.</p><p><strong>Ladybug Tattoos:&nbsp;</strong>Ladybugs bring Lady Luck&nbsp;whenever they fly by Legend has it that you&#8217;ll have luck and prosperity. If a ladybug lands on you. Ladybug Tattoos represent Love, Luck, and all life&#8217;s richest blessings.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mahamrityunjaya Mantra is one among the oldest and most important Mantra in Indian mythology and spirituality. This mantra belongs to Lord Shiva. It is a combination of three Hindi language words i.e. ‘Maha’, which means great, ‘Mrityun’ means death and ‘Jaya’ means victory, which turns into conqueror victory over death.It is also known as ‘Rudra Mantra’ or ‘Trayambakam Mantra’. The Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra is said to have been created by Rishi Markandeya. The Moon was once in trouble, cursed by King Daksha.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Someone rightly said once that God could not be anywhere and that is why he created mothers.</strong></p><p>Mothers are truly special and one can never do enough to show them just how much they are loved and appreciated.&nbsp;Nothing speaks better than a permanent tattoo. Tattoos are like preserving and expressing love for as long as you are alive. Mothers and special and so they deserve a special place in your life and what better way than to keep her with you forever on a part of you. It is nothing but a sign of truly unbreakable bond.</p><p>Mothers expect nothing but unconditional love and support from her children and what better way to show her that with a simple but beautiful tattoo. Some mothers definitely do not want to see their children going through pain and getting a permanent tattoo is a little painful but if she sees that you went through that pain just because you love her, she would surely grow bigger with love.</p><p><strong>Maa Tattoo,  don’t require words as they are a language on their own.</strong></p><p>Today mother and daughter even get matching tattoos which are not only adorable but make other mother-daughter pairs envious. Sharing a common tattoo is a lot more personal and deep than just doing something together.</p><p>Mothers daughters and grandmothers nowadays have matching tattoos and this concept of generation tattoos is beautiful. Tattoos don’t have to be large and colorful to convey feelings. Even a small, sweet tattoo is enough to show love and gratitude. You can get a tattoo for your mom or with your mom to establish bond just as deep as blood bond. In case of mom tattoos or mother daughter tattoos, less is definitely more. No one else deserves a place on your body more than your mother because she kept you in her womb for nine months. She nurtured you and cared for you not because she had any selfish interests but because she loves you with all her heart.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/maa-tattoo/">Maa Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two common symbols for <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">zen enso</a>. One is a brushstroke of a closed circle. The closed circle represents the totality of experience and life. The other is a brushstroke of a circle with one small opening. The open circle represents the imperfection found in all things and suggests to the student to stop striving for perfection and instead to allow the universe to be as it is.</p><p><strong>Z<a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">en Tattoo</a></strong></p><p>The open circle is a concept that reflects closely with Japanese Zen Buddhism. The Japanese concept of wabi-sabi is that all things are perfect as they are. An analogy is a peasant&#8217;s jar, misshapen, chipped and worn through years of daily use. Although it may not be as pleasing visually as a pristine carefully crafted jar, it is said to stimulate the mind and emotions, stimulate the spirit of a person to contemplate the essence of reality. As with everything related to Zen, there is a beautiful simplicity to the traditional enso, both the open and closed versions.</p><p><strong>The classic symbol for Zen is the enso. It is known as the circle of enlightenment.</strong></p><p>In the sixth century, a text named the Shinhinmei refers to the way of Zen as a circle of vast space, lacking nothing, and nothing in excess. At first glance, the ancient enso zen symbol appears to be nothing more than a circle. But it&#8217;s symbolism refers to the beginning and end of all things, the circle of life, &amp; the connectedness of existence.</p><p>It is said that in the hands of a Zen master. The power of the enso symbol for zen is released. Helping those who meditate upon it to reach a higher level of consciousness. It is used as a symbol of enlightenment. Zen masters often brush paint an enso for their student to meditate upon. The quality of the brushwork is said to reveal the depth of the master&#8217;s enlightenment.</p><p><strong>Lotus flower tattoo designs</strong></p><p>are widely preferred by tattoo lovers all around the world. Popular amongst both, men &amp; women, lotus design is not only revered for its beauty, but also reflects a deeper spiritual meaning. The flower grows in muddy water, yet symbolizes purity and harmony. As a tattoo design too, lotus stands for the same attributes in human nature &amp; depicts the thoughts and attitude of the bearer.</p><p>Lotus flower is amongst the most amazing creations of nature and its beauty lies in its purity. The aesthetic brilliance of this wonderful flower has made it one of the most popular objects used in tattoo designs. Tattoo art has used natural objects such as&nbsp;dreamcatchers,&nbsp;feathers,&nbsp;anchors,&nbsp;flowers&nbsp;to make attractive depiction on human body. Lotus flower finds a great degree of usage in traditional as well as contemporary tattoo art. This attractive and eye catching lotus flower tattoo designs are a hot favorite among tattoo lovers. In the East as well as the West, and is featured in diverse sizes and colors &amp; on various parts of the body. Giving an elegant look to the tattoo bearer. The lotus flower not only looks beautiful when used in tattoo art, but also has a deeper meaning, as explained in various cultures &amp; religions across the world.</p><p><span id="Lotus_Flower_Tattoo_Placement_and_Designs"><strong>Lotus Flower Tattoo Placement and Designs</strong></span></p><p>It can be combined with certain images to convey the personal beliefs of the wearer &amp; can be much more than a style statement for him. Chinese tattoo art includes some inspirational characters along with the lotus, while Buddhists. May have the image of the Buddha added to it, in order to represent enlightenment. It is not only the design in lotus tattoos which is of great significance. But also the color chosen by the wearer matters a lot. As far as the appearance and symbolism of the tattoo is concerned.
