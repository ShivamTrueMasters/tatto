										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are looking for a Sister Tattoo that you can share with your sister, then we have some amazing styles that you can choose from. Getting any type of ink is a big commitment, especially if you are getting it with someone. Getting a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">tattoo</a>&nbsp;with someone else is serious business, so you want to make sure that you both love it. Sisters always have a strong bond and a tattoo can be a symbol of that bond. A sister’s bond is unbreakable, you know that and you want to share that. A sister can be so much more than a family member. A sister can be your best friend, a confidant, and your one true soul mate.</p><p>By getting a tattoo with your sister, you can strengthen the bond of friendship and love so much more. It’s a great way to show your love. There is a lot of meaning in matching tattoos. If you want to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">symbolize your&nbsp;</a>sisterhood, then try out a matching tattoo design. It will be a fun way for the both of you to connect together. It will be something special that will draw you closer together. Get a tattoo that both of you will enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>Wrists are quite commonplace to get a tattoo. Choosing a cute wrist tattoo will show your love and your connection with your sister.&nbsp; It can be a small tattoo or a good size tattoo like the photo above.&nbsp; This is sweet, cute, and innocent, showing two girls on swings that are sisters. &nbsp;As you can see in the photo, the two tattoos are the opposite of each other.&nbsp; Of course, when you get together, you have to take a photo like the one above to show off your matching tattoos!</p><p>Sisters may drive you crazy, get into your stuff and irritate you. However, if anyone else dares say so, a sister will defend you to the death.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/sister-tattoo/">Matching Tattoos</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Portrait Tattoo on Chest</strong></p><p>Portrait tattoos are an interesting form of body art as they feature beautiful portraits of people that not only look good but hold immense personal significance for the wearer. There can be various reasons as to why one might choose to wear a portrait tattoo. For many people, these tattoos serve as a sign of memorial for a loved one who has passed away. Some may also opt for these tattoos in order to show love and respect for a lover, a friend or one’s children. There are a number of ways in which these tattoos can be done.</p><p>A tattoo design featuring the headshot of an individual is the most common form of a portrait tattoo. These tattoos mostly lack a background, although that can be added if one wants to. The tattoo may also contain other details such as the name of the person portrayed in the design, the date of birth or the date of death. Other symbols that can be added to these tattoos include winged angels, praying hands or across.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">One great tattoo that you may want to consider is the portrait tattoo</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Portrait tattoos are a great way to give someone the appreciation and dedication that they deserve. Of course, portrait tattoos can be worn by all walks of life. Truth be told, there are a variety of reasons why men and women choose portrait tattoo designs. Portrait tattoo designs can also be designed in various ways other then a single portrait of someone.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">As mentioned above, there are many reasons why people will decide to choose a Portrait Tattoo on Chest</a></strong></p><p>One of the more common reasons that men and women choose portrait tattoos is for it to serve as a memorial or dedication tattoo. As we go through life, we lose those that are dear to our heart. Keeping their memory alive within us can be well represented with a tattoo. Many men and women choose portrait tattoos that will display their children. This is another popular reason why people choose portrait tattoos. You may just have a special person in mind that has been there through it all. All of these are popular reasons that portrait tattoos are chosen.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portrait-tattoo-2/">Portrait Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>History and Background</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">Lord Krishna</a>, the eighth avatar of God Vishnu is worshiped as a supreme God in Hinduism. Born in northern India (around 3,228 BCE), Lord Krishna’s life marks the passing of the Dvapara age and beginning of the Kal yuga (which is also considered as the current age).Krishna Tattoo</p><p>References to Lord Krishna can be found in several Hindu mythological books, especially in the epic Hindu book, the Mahabharata.</p><p>Lord Krishna is also described as an important figure in the Bhagavata Purana. This is another Hindu epic book that dates to the 10th century B.C. In the text, Lord Krishna is described as the charioteer for the warrior Arjuna who had guided him morally and gave military counsel to the leader.</p><p>There came a time when Mother Earth was unable to bear the sins and cruelty committed by evil kings and rulers. Mother Earth then prayed to Lord Brahma, the creator of the Universe, to relieve her from these sinful kings. Lord Brahma prayed to the supreme Lord Vishnu for reincarnation and to relieve the Mother Earth from these evil rulers. Lord Vishnu accepted the request and assured to defeat tyrannical forces.</p><p>The ruler of Mathura, Kansa was one such evil king. He had a sister named Devaki, who was married to Vasudeva. The day Devaki and Vasudeva got married, a voice from the sky forecasted that Devaki’s eighth son will bring an end to Kansa’s rule and will kill him.Krishna Tattoo</p><p>Frightened Kansa held the couple. He then vowed that he will kill every child of Devaki and Vasudeva. Seeing their first seven children being killed by the cruel Kansa, the imprisoned couple feared giving birth to their eighth child.</p><p><strong>One night Lord Vishnu appeared before them.</strong></p><p>He told them that in the guise of their son, he will return and rescue them from Kansa’s autocracy.</p><p>The divine baby was born and the day he was born, Vasudeva found himself magically freed from prison. He ran away with the infant to a safer house and Lord Vishnu removed all the obstacles from Vasudeva’s path.</p><p>Vasudeva reached a house in Gokul, exchanged Lord Krishna with a new born girl of Yashoda and Nanda and returned to the prison with the girl child. As soon as Kansa came to know about the new-born, he again tried to kill the child. The infant ascends to the heavens and transformed into the goddess Yogamaya and said, “O foolish Kansa! What will you get by killing me? Your nemesis is already born.”Krishna Tattoo</p><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">Krishna</a>&nbsp;was raised as a cowherd in Gokul and became a skilful musician. On his return to Mathura, he slayed Kansa and restored his father to power.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/krishna-tattoo-2/">Krishna Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Shiva got furious and chopped the boys head off.</p><p>When Parvati found this, she was shocked. She explained the whole situation to Shiva and asked him to save their son. Shiva sent his men to the forest to find him a head of the first dead animal they can find. The men returned with an elephant head and Shiva used the head to make the boy alive again and Ganesha was born.</p><p>The elephant’s head symbolizes unmatched wisdom and knowledge gained through reflection and listening.</p><p>Because of his role as a mother’s doorkeeper, statues of Ganesha is often placed at the doors to keep out the unworthy.</p><p><strong>Meanings behind Ganesha’s Appearance</strong></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Ganesha has a pot belly that represents generosity and total acceptance.</li><li>Ganesha has a single tusk that signifies one-pointedness.</li><li>Ganesha’s skin color is bright red.</li><li>Ganesha has four arms that hold a noose called Pasha that represents his power to bind and free obstacles, an elephant goad symbolic of how one should steer the soul away from the ignorance and illusions of this world just like a mahout steers an elephant away from any treacherous path, and a pot of sweets offering rewards, other hand provides blessings.</li><li><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">Ganesha uses a mouse as his mount.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter how bad your day is, the sweet chirping of a songbird can pull you out of a funk. The sound of a bird reflected all of the possibilities that the day could bring. Subconsciously, humans still listen for the first whistles of the birds that signify that morning has become.</p><p>Many of the bird’s traits are things that human beings aspire to.

In mythology, the Phoenix was said to die in a fiery flame and then rise again from the ashes. As such, the Phoenix was a symbol of rebirth and transformation. Early Christians used the Phoenix to represent the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The longevity of the Phoenix was also symbolic for the way that Christians would survive persecution and destruction to rise from the proverbial ashes.</p><p><strong>Dove Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><p>For thousands of years, the dove has been a symbol of love and peace.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/"><strong>Polynesian Armband tattoo</strong></a></p><p>The intricacy and abstract nature of Polynesian armband tattoo have led to their continued popularity for hundreds of years. They are some of the most varied and eye-catching designs available anywhere in the world, and they have such a wide spectrum of meanings that just about anyone can find a tribal armband tattoo that fits with their life.</p><p><strong>Tiki</strong></p><p>Tiki is a human-like figure that represents Polynesian semi-gods, which means deified ancestors and heads, who are sublimed after their death. According to its guardian role, they mainly symbolize protection. If you love playing pc games, you’ll find that in many lost temples, Tiki patterns are often carved on pillars or stone gate.</p><p>Tiki plays a very important role in Polynesian culture. For example, nose symbols mean sniffing danger before its coming. Tiki’s eyes, nose, mouth and side faces are all important design elements and most Polynesian tattoo designs contain one or more tiki symbols.</p><p><strong>Sea Shell</strong></p><p>In Polynesian tattoo designs, shells are very common in many designs, especially turtle shells. Turtle shell is a symbolization of turtle, which is a very important sea creature in all the cultures of the Polynesian triangle. It has more meanings than other symbols. Some complex turtle designs could have quite a lot of meanings, according to its elements embedded in. Basically, turtle shells symbolize longevity, wellness, fertility, and peace</p><p><strong>Shark Teeth</strong></p><p>Shark teeth are another fish symbol which is very popular among Polynesian tattoo fans.&nbsp; Nearly over 50% of Polynesian tattoo designs have shark teeth symbols embedded in.</p><p>Shark teeth usually represent shelter or coverage, guidance, power, ferocity, adaptability, etc. In Polynesian legend, sharks also represent the god of Polynesian people.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Creation of Adam&nbsp;is a&nbsp;fresco&nbsp;painting by Italian artist&nbsp;Michelangelo, which forms part of the&nbsp;Sistine Chapel&#8217;s ceiling.</p><p>It illustrates the&nbsp;Biblical&nbsp;creation narrative&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Book of Genesis&nbsp;in which&nbsp;God&nbsp;gives life to&nbsp;Adam. The fresco is part of a complex iconographic scheme and is chronologically the fourth in the series of panels depicting episodes from Genesis.</p><p>The image of the near-touching hands of God and Adam has become iconic of&nbsp;humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Michelangelo&#8217;s&nbsp;<em>Creation of Adam</em>&nbsp;is one of the most replicated religious paintings of all time.</p><p>During the same period, <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">Michelangelo</a> painted the ceiling of the <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">Sistine Chape</a>l. Which took approximately four years to complete (1508–1512).&#8221;The Hand of God&#8221; is perhaps the most enduring of Michelangelo&#8217;s paintings. Almost five centuries later this image remains prevalent and is still being used in advertising and on posters and T-shirts.This is particularly true of the detail that shows the two hands as they reach towards each other, tantalizingly close, almost touching.The panel illustrates the moment when life is instilled in Adam by God. Michelangelo has placed the central focus upon the hands of God and of Adam, not just by the placement of the figures, but also by the two outstretched arms.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">hand is limp</a>, the fingers are drooping as if they are without energy, awaiting the vital spark of life.</p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/creation-of-adam-tattoo/"><strong>Creation of Adam Tattoo</strong></a></p><p>One of the questions that has been raised about this scene is the identity of the figures next to God.&nbsp; Given her privileged placement under the arm of God, the female figure is presumably an important one.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/creation-of-adam-tattoo/">Creation of Adam Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>THE MEANING OF THE OM SYMBOL </strong></p><p>‘Om’,&nbsp;‘Ohm’&nbsp;or&nbsp;‘Aum’&nbsp;is a sacred sound that is known generally, as the sound of the universe. Om is all encompassing, the essence of ultimate reality, and unifies everything in the universe. The vibrations that the Om sound creates are thought to energize, the chakras throughout the body.</p><p>Especially the third eye and crown chakras, which help us connect with our Divine selves.which is chanted to connect with and energize the chakras. </p><p>The Om symbol represents the sound in a visual form and has a lot of meaning behind it. </p><p>Om is one of the most important spiritual symbols and is found throughout many ancient Hindu texts, prayers and ceremonies.</p><p><strong>Elements of the Om Symbol</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The&nbsp;Om symbol is a combination of curves, a crescent and a dot. The meaning of the Om symbol, while purely looking at its visual form, the states of consciousness that&nbsp;Aum&nbsp;represents. The letter &#8216;A&#8217;&nbsp;represents the&nbsp;waking state, &#8216;U&#8217; represents the dream state and &#8216;M&#8217; is the unconscious state, or state of deep sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the symbol, the waking state is represented by the bottom curve.The dream state is the middle curve and the state of deep sleep is represented with the upper curve. </p><p>Om Shiva Tattoo, The crescent shape above the curves denotes Maya, or Illusion. Which is the obstacle that sits in the way of reaching the highest state of bliss. </p><p> The dot at the top of the symbol represents the absolute state. Which is the fourth state of consciousness and is absolute peace and bliss. This fourth state is believed to be the state in which someone could truly connect with the Divine.</p><p><strong>Who is Shiva?</strong></p><p>Shiva is the third god in the Hindu triumvirate. Om Shiva Tattoo, The triumvirate consists of three gods who are responsible for the creation, upkeep and destruction of the world. The other two gods are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/deities/brahma.shtml">Brahma</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/deities/vishnu.shtml">Vishnu</a>.</p><p>Brahma is the creator of the universe while Vishnu is the preserver of it. Shiva&#8217;s role is to destroy the universe in order to re-create it.</p><p>Hindus believe his powers of destruction and recreation are used even now to destroy the illusions and imperfections of this world, paving the way for beneficial change. According to Hindu belief, this destruction is not arbitrary, but constructive. Shiva is therefore seen as the source of both good and evil and is regarded as the one who combines many contradictory elements.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/om-shiva-tattoo/">Om Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The compass tattoo has been a popular choice among a majority of cultures for centuries. This maritime symbol was popular among early sailors. Getting a compass tattoo would protect them. On rough waters and ensure that you would return home safely.</p><p>One of the main reasons sailors opted for this tattoo was that of protection. As a token of good luck, images of compasses painted on the ships as well. The seas were rough and unforgiving. Often times ships and the men onboard would disappear without a trace so these images served as a beacon of hope that they would be guided out of the treacherous waters alive.</p><p>Compass tattoos can come in a variety of styles and variations. These include,&nbsp;star compass, astrocompass, lodestone compass, Vegvisir compass and prismatic compass.</p><p><strong>The star compass is the most popular of the aforementioned designs and is said to represent the North Star.</strong></p><p>Before maps and technology existed, humans used the North Star to guide them in the right direction. Because of this, this style of tattoo stands for guidance, direction and finding a way home.</p><p>A way of depicting this is to include an image of a clock or hourglass with the compass in the tattoo design. Maps and earth play a role as well as maps, like compasses, help a user determine their location.</p><p>Compass tattoos have also represented the ideal of following one’s dreams. It is symbolic of staying your course in life and to not give up no matter how rough things may seem.</p><p>The compass will guide you where you need to be.</p><p>Overall, this type of tattoo conveys guidance and direction, but you may add additional design elements to your tattoo to have it depict a meaning that is significant to you.</p><p>#compasstattoo #ClockAndCompassTattoo #Compass #tattoo #tattoos #girlswithtattoos #tattooed #tattooartist #tattooart #tattooedgirls #guyswithtattoos #instatattoo #tattoolife #tattoodesign #traditionaltattoo #tattooflash #tattooist #tattoogirl #handtattoo #tattooedgirl #sleevetattoo #tattooing #tattooshop #blacktattoo #chesttattoo #tattoosofinstagram #rosetattoo #blackandgreytattoo #tattoomodel #tattooer #colortattoo</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/nautical-star-compass-tattoo-2/">Anchor Compass Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A roaring lion is an animal to be respected and feared. It is a symbol of Power and Authority and a sign that you aren&#8217;t a person to be taken lightly. Roaring lions are born leaders, gifted fighters, and, in a crunch, are the persons who can best guide the group out of danger.&nbsp;<span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s1">t</span><span class="s1">he tradition</span>, a lion whelp was still-born but brought to life by the roar of his father. The whelp later went on to create and lead the tribes of Israel. The symbolism shows that the word of the Divine (represented by the roaring Lion) has the power to breathe life into weakest being (the whelp) and transform him into a force to be reckoned with. A Roaring Lion Tattoo expresses to the world that you aren&#8217;t a pushover and that a beast lies underneath the surface, primed and ready to strike.</p><p>Aside from the basic verbal symbolism of the lion, there are some deeper meanings connected to them as well.</p><p>Lion tattoos have been placed on men throughout history. Those in Asia, Africa, India and the Middle East have put great emphasis on the lion tattoo for many centuries. Lions have always known as the king of the jungle and this status portrays great power. I think this has always been the big draw about the lion tattoo. If you think about it, the lion can also be a symbol of a religious nature. King of the Jungle – King of Kings.</p><p><b>Ancient Civilizations</b></p><p>The lion has been portrayed for many years in ancient cultures, legends, mythology, astrology, literature, movies, and much more. In a few ancient civilizations, lions were owned by kings and royalty. The lion was a symbol of power to the people of the king&#8217;s&nbsp;power&nbsp;and&nbsp;strength. In an interesting contrast, in Roman mythology, the lion is associated with&nbsp;love.</p><p>The lion was also symbolic to the Egyptians they often portrayed two lions with their backs to one another. These statues represented&nbsp;balance, which was very important to the Egyptians. They would usually place these statues outside of sacred structures. The Egyptians believed in balance, such as sunrise sunset and east-west their lion statues represented this all-important balance.</p><p><strong>Religion</strong></p><p>The lion is also a symbol of Christianity. Some Christians use the lion tattoo to symbolize Christian beliefs. The lion is also a symbolic figure to Islam, in which the lion and the sword represent power. The lion is also a solar animal. This means that the lion has sun-like qualities and characteristics. In many culture and beliefs, the lion is associated with the sun. It is said that the the lion&#8217;s mane looks like the rays of the sun—a trait that many tattoos often highlight. In other ancient myths, the lion represents the&nbsp;transformation&nbsp;and journey from childhood to adulthood.</p><p><strong>Culture</strong></p><p>The lion is also very symbolic to the Chinese. It represents a symbol of good luck,&nbsp;guardianship, and power. The Chinese also believe that the lion is a symbol of the earth and sun. Many people know that the lion &#8220;Leo&#8221; is part of the Zodiac. Leo is the 5th sign of the Zodiac, and anyone born between July 23-August 22 is considered to be a Leo. People born during this time are very highly energetic and are good hearted people. The Leo is somewhat timid and enjoys control, but they are very generous. The Leo also represents balance.</p><p>As you now know, the lion has been portrayed throughout human history and they have been symbolic figures for many years. It is one of the most symbolic animal tattoos that are available. Due to all the different meanings it holds, it is highly sought after in the tattoo world. There are also a variety of different designs and styles for it as well. There are tribal designs and Celtic designs, and many more. Before choosing a final design, make sure you check out every style and design that is available. Make sure you choose a design that you are satisfied with.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/lion-tattoo-on-arm/">Lion Tattoo on Arm</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hourglass Tattoo History</strong></p><p>Invented in Alexandria somewhere around 150 B.C., the hourglass plays an important part in the life of history. Used to measure time accurately and repeatedly, hourglasses saved the lives of many before someone invented the modern clock.</p><p><strong>Hourglass Tattoo</strong></p><p>While primitive, their small measurements helped synchronize groups of people. Few alternatives match the abilities of the hourglass.</p><p><strong>Hourglass Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><p>When the&nbsp;hourglass’s popularity spread from Egypt into northern countries, the strange depiction of time captured the hearts of artists and philosophers. It was the only symbol that could depict both the past and the present at the same time, so it came to represent both life and death. Its sands would flow regardless of the elements around it—just as a person’s life winds down at a steady pace, regardless of their good or bad deeds—so it was also used to instill a fear of death into people. Pirates adopted it for their flags, and people still place it on gravestones and coffins.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/hourglass-tattoo/">Hourglass Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="ctl01_mainContent_39661"><strong>The Five Eternal Elements</strong></p><p>When Bhagwan Swaminarayan set out on His spiritual journey at eleven years of age, He halted only after getting a reply to the question He had asked all across India. On His quest, He asked about the five eternal elements as revealed in the Vedas. He found a reasonable answer in Loj from Ramananad Swami’s chief disciple, Muktanand Swami. He accepted Ramanand Swami as His guru and then established the Swaminarayan Sampraday in Gujarat. Bhagwan Swaminarayan describes these five eternal elements and their relationship in great detail throughout the Vachanamrut.</p><p><strong>Pramukh Swami Tattoo These five eternal elements are: Jiva, Ishwar, Maya, Brahma, and Parabrahma. </strong></p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl07_divpagercontrol"><strong>Jiva &#8211; The Soul</strong></p><p>One&#8217;s true identity is not this human body, but the jiva that resides within it.&nbsp;The jiva, also called &#8216;atma&#8217; or soul, is eternal &#8211; it cannot be destroyed. The jiva has no gender; it is neither male nor female.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan discusses the nature of the jiva throughout the Vachanamrut.&nbsp;It is said to reside in our bodies in the same area as the heart.&nbsp;“Childhood, youth, old age, stoutness, thinness, birth and death are all aspects of the body.</p><p>On the other hand, being uncuttable, being unpierceable, not aging, being immortal, being the embodiment of gnan [wisdom], being the embodiment of bliss, and being characterized by eternal existence are all aspects of the atma; they should in no way be considered as belonging to the body.” The jiva is free and pure, but we believe that we are restrained by maya. Once we understand that we are not this body and worship Purna Purushottam Narayan, we realize that our jiva is free from the clutches of maya and is worthy of moksha. The very essence of the Brahma-Parabrahma spiritual journey is to believe one’s self to be the atma and not this body, to become atmarup, and to worship Purna Purshottam Narayan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ishwar &#8211; Divinities</strong></p><p>Ishwar transcends the jiva. It is the next element above the jiva.&nbsp;These beings partake in the creation, sustenance, and destruction of each universe.&nbsp;Ishwars are conscious spiritual beings that have greater realization than jivas.</p><p>While the jiva must work to realize its divine presence within the human body, ishwar is aware of that divinity. There are infinite ishwars, and but they are all bound by maya. Just as Purna Purshottam Narayan controls the jiva, He also controls the ishwars. Like the jivas, ishwars too aim to surpass maya and attain moksha.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl09_divpagercontrol"><strong>Maya &#8211; Ignorance</strong></p><p>Maya is the ignorance that separates the jivas and ishwars from Brahma and Parabrahma. It is the desire that hinders a spiritual aspirant’s path to moksha. Maya directly translates to attachment for worldly objects. Maya is the instrument through which Parabrahma facilitates karma and moksha. Only when a devotee is able to overcome maya overcome the darkness of attachment to worldly objects is he or she able to attain moksha. Maya manifests from physical matter, and it is difficult for the jiva or ishwar to transcend. Bhagwan Swaminarayan has advocated the jiva to engage in constant bhakti or devotion to God. To move beyond maya and towards one&#8217;s liberation.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl10_divpagercontrol"><strong>Aksharbrahma &#8211; The Eternal Abode</strong></p><p>The gunatit sadhu, Aksharbrahma, is the pathway to God and to moksha. It is only through Aksharbrahma that a jiva can associate itself with God and understand Him well enough to seek complete refuge in Him, thereby bringing the jiva out of the darkness of maya and into the light of Parabrahma. IParabrahma &#8211; GodIn the Vachanamrut, Bhagwan Swaminarayan has described this Supreme God as all-knowing, all-powerful and yet compassionate. This Parabrahma governs all the other four elements of jiva, ishwar, maya and brahma. Swaminarayan devotees believe Bhagwan Swaminarayan to be Parabrahma.&nbsp;In the Vibhuti Yoga Adhyaya of the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, Shri Krishna speaks of that Supreme God living and working through him.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan in the Vachanamrut says that Purna Purushottam Narayan resides in Akshardham and visits this Earth to establish dharma for the sake of His devotees. He is always present in human form (pragat).&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/pramukh-swami-tattoo/">Pramukh Swami Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beetles have also caught the eye, and prayers, of those people seeking Divine intervention. By far, the most well-known beetle to grace the surface of religious artifacts is the Scarab Beetle. Known as&nbsp;<em>&#8216;The Creator&#8217;</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>&#8216;The Khepri&#8217;</em>&nbsp;in ancient Egypt, Scarab Beetles were believed to be a representation of the Sun God and the way they rolled their dung ball across the hot desert sands was said to be a cosmic re-enactment of the ancient Sun god,&nbsp;Atum, pushing the sun across the vast sky.</p><p>The Egyptian name for the Scarab Beetle (Kheper) translates into&nbsp;<em>&#8216;to come into existence and transform&#8217;</em>and their connection with the Divine accounts for why important Egyptians like pharaohs and noblemen were buried lots of Scarab Beetles and their tomb walls were filled with images of the insect in its spiritual quest to&nbsp;<em>&#8216;push the Sun across the sky&#8217;</em>.</p><p><strong>Bejeweled Scarabs were wrapped in the mummified pharaoh&#8217;s bandages in the belief that this would help him to reawaken in the land of the Dead and start his journey towards resurrection.</strong></p><p>Outside of the Egyptian spiritual realm, beetles became renowned as signs of good fortune. Ladybugs are common characters in children&#8217;s stories and play. Many non-profits that promote tolerance and peace use the image of an adorable Ladybug to easily convey their message. Who knows, it might bring your soul mate to you.</p><p><strong>The Meaning of Beetle Tattoo Designs</strong></p><p>The types of&nbsp;beetles&nbsp;on the face of the Earth are as numerous as the amount of sand on a beach. These include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Nobility</li><li>The Divine</li><li>Luck</li><li>Love</li><li>Prosperity and Abundance</li><li>Strength</li><li>Creation and Immortality</li><li>Organization and Discipline</li></ul><p><strong>Beetel-tattoo Design Variations</strong></p><p><strong>From the delicate contours and vibrant colors of the Ladybug to the strong outline of the Scarab Beetle, these tattoos come in all colors and sizes.</strong></p><p>Whether or not you add other elements to your design depends largely on the type of beetle you want to on your body.</p><p><strong>Scarab Beetle Tattoos</strong><br>
It&#8217;s hard to picture ancient Egypt and the famous tombs of her pharaohs. Without the iconic image of the Scarab Beetle. From tomb walls and chariots to official seals, the Scarab Beetle was a reminder of the pharaoh&#8217;s divine power to the ordinary citizens. Scarab Beetles are totems of&nbsp;Atum, the creator god and represent a connection to the powerful forces of Creation, Renewal, and Transformation.</p><p><strong>Ladybug Tattoos:&nbsp;</strong>Ladybugs bring Lady Luck&nbsp;whenever they fly by Legend has it that you&#8217;ll have luck and prosperity. If a ladybug lands on you. Ladybug Tattoos represent Love, Luck, and all life&#8217;s richest blessings. These tattoos are for&nbsp;Flower Power children&nbsp;and are more often embodiments of your love for Nature.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/beetel-tattoo/">Beetel Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us have owned or seen diamonds at some point. When we think about them, we often think about wealth, luxury and fashion, even the higher quality of one&#8217;s life. Some people wear diamonds on their ring fingers while others wear them on their skin, having a micro dermally implanted diamond. Diamonds have decorated all types of ancient and royal crowns and are called a &#8220;<i>girl&#8217;s best friend.</i>&#8220;</p><p><b>History:</b>&nbsp;The word &#8220;diamond&#8221; is Greek in origin (<span class="s1">ἀ</span>δάμας–<i>adámas</i>&nbsp;or &#8220;unbreakable&#8221;) and means strength and invincibility. They are made of a nearly indestructible mineral, created deep in the earth by massive pressure weighing down on carbon deposits and then brought up to the earth&#8217;s surface via volcanic eruptions. One of the earliest recorded accounts of diamonds was from India around 400 BC. Today, most come from Africa.</p><p><b>Beauty:</b>&nbsp;You&#8217;ll find diamonds in fashion magazines and on any red carpet or runway. There are sayings that equate these gems with inner beauty (like a &#8220;diamond in the rough&#8221;). which is apt, since they appear rough on the outside when first mined, but once they are polished, their beauty is revealed. To the tattoo wearer, the diamond may represent inner beauty, as in the saying, &#8220;true beauty is found on the inside.&#8221;</p><p><b>Power:</b>&nbsp;We often associate diamonds with wealth and the power that money can bring. The gem is very expensive and multiple diamonds may represent great wealth and value. They are extremely coveted items and some people will do anything to get their hands on them.</p><p><b>Words about Diamonds:</b>&nbsp;As I stated earlier, some tattoos incorporate famous quotes or personal words to underline and accentuate the meaning of the tattoo. These quotes may be placed on ribbons or&nbsp;<span class="s2">banners</span>&nbsp;or inked inside or outside the diamond design. Another popular thing that people do is have the first letter of their own name. The name of a loved one inked inside the diamond.</p><p><b>Diamond as a Birthstone:</b>&nbsp;People born in April claim the diamond as their birthstone. A tattoo may be used to represent the month a person was born. Since diamonds are associated with the month of April. The gem might be used as a symbolic representation of anything or anyone that began that month.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/diamond-wings-tattoo/">Diamond Wings Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Infinity tattoos are steadily on the rise with many people opting to get these in one form or another.</strong></p><p>The <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">infinity</a> symbol, often used in mathematics, represents a never-ending loop and is depicted as a number 8 on its side. In the tattoo world, this can be seen as a symbol of never-ending or limitless possibility. Some cultures also believe it to represent rebirth or reincarnation.</p><p>Historically, this symbol is similar to mythological creatures such as Ouroboros; the snake which consumed its tail and became a creature without end. Often when people get their infinity tattoo, for this reason, they are showing that they are both into mythology and that they like the creatures that the symbol represents. These aren’t the deepest meanings for the infinity tattoo, but they can always attach more meanings to the design later on.</p><p><strong>The endless loops and circles that comprise the infinity symbol can also be likened to the seasonal cycle which endlessly repeats year after year.</strong></p><p>In this way, the infinity tattoo could mean that the person wants to keep their eye on the ball no matter what time of year it is. It could also mean that they don’t necessarily have a favorite season. But instead choose to enjoy their lives regardless of the time of year it currently is.</p><p>These <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">infinity tattoos</a>, while simple, can be customized in a variety of ways.</p><p>Popular choices for this type of tattoo include a word or phrase. Inside the loop, such as “love”, “life” or “friendship”.</p><p>These, of course, signify a relationship that will never end. And are often used as matching tattoos for two or more people.</p><p>One can even add additional symbols such a hearts, stars or other embellishments. To add to the flair of the design.</p><p>The fact is that the infinity symbol itself is a bit bland unless holds a lot of meaning to you.</p><p>so many people decide to surround it with other images that make the meaning come to life a bit more.</p><p>As always, it comes down to the tastes of the person getting the infinity tattoo.</p><p>If they are able to find a design that works well with the infinity symbol.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/infinity-sign-tattoo/">Infinity Sign Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Someone rightly said once that God could not be anywhere and that is why he created mothers.</strong></p><p>Mothers are truly special and one can never do enough to show them just how much they are loved and appreciated.&nbsp;Nothing speaks better than a permanent tattoo. Tattoos are like preserving and expressing love for as long as you are alive. Mothers and special and so they deserve a special place in your life and what better way than to keep her with you forever on a part of you. It is nothing but a sign of truly unbreakable bond.</p><p>Mothers expect nothing but unconditional love and support from her children and what better way to show her that with a simple but beautiful tattoo. Some mothers definitely do not want to see their children going through pain and getting a permanent tattoo is a little painful but if she sees that you went through that pain just because you love her, she would surely grow bigger with love.</p><p><strong>Maa Tattoo,  don’t require words as they are a language on their own.</strong></p><p>Today mother and daughter even get matching tattoos which are not only adorable but make other mother-daughter pairs envious. Sharing a common tattoo is a lot more personal and deep than just doing something together.</p><p>Mothers daughters and grandmothers nowadays have matching tattoos and this concept of generation tattoos is beautiful. Tattoos don’t have to be large and colorful to convey feelings. Even a small, sweet tattoo is enough to show love and gratitude. You can get a tattoo for your mom or with your mom to establish bond just as deep as blood bond. In case of mom tattoos or mother daughter tattoos, less is definitely more. No one else deserves a place on your body more than your mother because she kept you in her womb for nine months. She nurtured you and cared for you not because she had any selfish interests but because she loves you with all her heart.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/maa-tattoo/">Maa Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Lion Tattoo</b></p><p><b>Roaring Lion Tattoo</b></p><p>A roaring lion is an animal to be respected and feared. It is a symbol of Power and Authority and a sign that you aren&#8217;t a person to be taken lightly. Roaring lions are born leaders, gifted fighters, and, in a crunch, are the persons who can best guide the group out of danger.&nbsp;<span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s1">t</span><span class="s1">he tradition</span>, a lion whelp was still-born but brought to life by the roar of his father. The whelp later went on to create and lead the tribes of Israel. The symbolism shows that the word of the Divine (represented by the roaring Lion) has the power to breathe life into weakest being (the whelp) and transform him into a force to be reckoned with. A Roaring Lion Tattoo expresses to the world that you aren&#8217;t a pushover and that a beast lies underneath the surface, primed and ready to strike.</p><p>Aside from the basic verbal symbolism of the lion, there are some deeper meanings connected to them as well.</p><p>Lion tattoos have been placed on men throughout history. Those in Asia, Africa, India and the Middle East have put great emphasis on the lion tattoo for many centuries. Lions have always known as the king of the jungle and this status portrays great power. I think this has always been the big draw about the lion tattoo. If you think about it, the lion can also be a symbol of a religious nature. King of the Jungle – King of Kings.</p><p><b>Ancient Civilizations</b></p><p>The lion has been portrayed for many years in ancient cultures, legends, mythology, astrology, literature, movies, and much more. In a few ancient civilizations, lions were owned by kings and royalty. The lion was a symbol of power to the people of the king&#8217;s&nbsp;power&nbsp;and&nbsp;strength. In an interesting contrast, in Roman mythology, the lion is associated with&nbsp;love.</p><p>The lion was also symbolic to the Egyptians they often portrayed two lions with their backs to one another. These statues represented&nbsp;balance, which was very important to the Egyptians. They would usually place these statues outside of sacred structures. The Egyptians believed in balance, such as sunrise sunset and east west their lion statues represented this all important balance.</p><p><strong>Religion</strong></p><p>The lion is also a symbol of Christianity. Some Christians use the lion tattoo to symbolize Christian beliefs. The lion is also a symbolic figure to Islam, in which the lion and the sword represent power. The lion is also a solar animal. This means that the lion has sun-like qualities and characteristics. In many culture and beliefs, the lion is associated with the sun. It is said that the the lion&#8217;s mane looks like the rays of the sun—a trait that many tattoos often highlight. In other ancient myths, the lion represents the&nbsp;transformation&nbsp;and journey from childhood to adulthood.</p><p><strong>Culture</strong></p><p>The lion is also very symbolic to the Chinese. It represents a symbol of good luck,&nbsp;guardianship, and power. The Chinese also believe that the lion is a symbol of the earth and sun. Many people know that the lion &#8220;Leo&#8221; is part of the Zodiac. Leo is the 5th sign of the Zodiac, and anyone born between July 23-August 22 is considered to be a Leo. People born during this time are very highly energetic and are good hearted people. The Leo is somewhat timid and enjoys control, but they are very generous. The Leo also represents balance.</p><p>As you now know, the lion has been portrayed throughout human history and they have been symbolic figures for many years. It is one of the most symbolic animal tattoos that are available. Due to all the different meanings it holds, it is highly sought after in the tattoo world. There are also a variety of different designs and styles for it as well. There are tribal designs and Celtic designs, and many more.

At first glance, the ancient enso zen symbol appears to be nothing more than a circle. But it&#8217;s symbolism refers to the beginning and end of all things, the circle of life, &amp; the connectedness of existence.</p><p>It is said that in the hands of a Zen master. The power of the enso symbol for zen is released. Helping those who meditate upon it to reach a higher level of consciousness. It is used as a symbol of enlightenment. Zen masters often brush paint an enso for their student to meditate upon. The quality of the brushwork is said to reveal the depth of the master&#8217;s enlightenment.</p><p><strong>Lotus flower tattoo designs</strong></p><p>are widely preferred by tattoo lovers all around the world. Popular amongst both, men &amp; women, lotus design is not only revered for its beauty, but also reflects a deeper spiritual meaning. The flower grows in muddy water, yet symbolizes purity and harmony. As a tattoo design too, lotus stands for the same attributes in human nature &amp; depicts the thoughts and attitude of the bearer.</p><p>Lotus flower is amongst the most amazing creations of nature and its beauty lies in its purity.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A nautical compass tattoo is a great way to show off your love for sailing.</p><p>The Nautical Compass Tattoo is a symbol of perseverance and determination. This tattoo design is often used on sailors who want to stay true to their path through life.</p><p>While the compass tattoo is not normally thought of as a popular “lucky charm” tattoo, it’s not hard to see why someone might give their tattoo this meaning. It is the type of tattoo you can look at when you have lost your way and use it to turn yourself around. When someone gets the compass tattoo to represent luck, they will usually get additional designs around it to make the meaning a bit more clear.</p><p><strong>Compasses give many a sense of security concerning their direction.</strong></p><p>We trust and understand the magnetic guidance that&#8217;s provided by the compass. Others use the compass on their body to symbolize remaining on course when faced with hardship. The compass can also be compared with the North Star as its placement stays reliable and static. The home can be located by a compass as well, and it&#8217;s because of this many travelers and adventurers adorn themselves with the compass tattoo. Compass tattoos can be embellished with globes and nautical stars as to adequately portray this meaning.</p><p><strong>Nautical Compass Tattoo has also represented the idea of following one’s dreams.</strong></p><p>Widely seen as a protective ornament, the compass has for a long time been held in high esteem by many. Military servicemen and women have used it as a symbol of their loyalty and reliance to their branch in the military.&nbsp;</p><p>Because it&#8217;s always pointing to the north and never changes, many view it as a beacon of inspiration.</p><p>Compass tattoos have also represented the idea of following one’s dreams.</p><p>A compass without a direction indicator can show a broken compass.</p><p>One with a wildly spinning arrow can mean confusion or uncertainty. One with a considerable long chain can show attachment to the associated meaning.</p><p>For instance, a chain connected to a religious item and a compass could indicate, that the person gets their direction.</p><p>A broken face plate can mean a lack of dependence on such tools. A compass that&#8217;s moldy or water filled.</p><p>A compass that moldy or water filled can show age or self-reliance.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/nautical-compass-tattoo/">Nautical Compass Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

All of us are possessive about our identity and it means a lot to us. We express it in different ways and the sun sign tattoos are also a way of expressing our identity. People who belong to the Sagittarius sun sign are natural tattoo lovers as they are blessed with an artistic bent of mind. They love to explore and research and are also very fiery and straight-forward. The Sagittarius tattoos are best for conveying the fact that one was born under the ninth sign of the zodiac and is ruled by the fire element.</p><p>The tattoo has got a very sexy display and stands out from all other sun signs tattoos. The centaur and the archer represent the Sagittarians. The arrow is the symbol of the ardent and passionate sun sign. Men and women love both the designs. Those who want a simple and cute look generally go for the symbol while the ones wishing for an elaborate and catchy display choose the centaur and the archer.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/sagittarius-zodiac-sign-tattoo/">Sagittarius Zodiac Sign Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sparta was a warrior society in ancient Greece that reached the height of its power after defeating rival city-state Athens in the Peloponnesian War (431-404 B.C.). Spartan culture centered on loyalty to the state and military service. At age 7, Spartan boys entered a rigorous state-sponsored education, military training, and socialization program. Known as the Agoge, the system emphasized duty, discipline, and endurance. Despite their military prowess, the Spartans’ dominance was short-lived: In 371 B.C., they were defeated by Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra, and their empire went into a long period of decline.</p><p><strong>Spartan, also known as Lacedaemon.</strong></p><p>Sparta was an ancient Greek city-state located primarily in the present-day region of southern Greece called Laconia. The population of Sparta consisted of three main groups: the Spartans, or Spartiates, who were full citizens; the Helots, or serfs/slaves; and the Perioeci, who were neither slaves nor citizens. The Perioeci, whose name means “dwellers-around,” worked as craftsmen and traders, and built weapons for the Spartans</p><p><i><strong>Spartan Warrior Tattoo</strong></i></p><p><i>The word “Spartan” means self-restrained, simple, frugal and austere.&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>Spartan tattoo</strong></p><p>Spartan boys started their military training at age 7 when they left home and entered the Agoge. Spartans also valued knowledge, took education seriously and even had a democratic government. They were the most feared military army in the Greek world between the 4th and 6th century.</p><p>&nbsp;As you will see they speak to the individual’s approach to life, those around them and their beliefs.</p><p><strong>Honor</strong></p><p>Spartans had a reputation for being honorable men who would lay down their lives to protect their society, way of life and their fellow warrior. In today’s modern world honor is hard to come by, so many choose a tattoo like this to remind them that the right thing to do and the hardest thing to do are often the same and they need to make honorable choices.</p><p><strong>Bravery</strong></p><p>They embodied bravery and even today people still admire their resolve and want to remember that if the Spartans could face such terrible circumstances and still stand firm that they can overcome life’s obstacles as well.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/spartan-warrior-tattoo/">SPARTAN WARRIOR TATTOO</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>World maps are not only exciting to look at, they conjure up all sorts of adventurous feelings when you are contemplating your next exotic journey or vacation. For some, they are not at home unless they are traveling to a distant airport and experiencing all that culture has to offer.</p><p>When these wandering spirits get inked, they choose the <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">world map tattoos</a> outlined only in the black ink, and they slowly color in each part of the world that they have visited along the way. This work-in-progress ink design inspires and drives many to always have their eyes on the next foreign sunrise.</p><p>Some of us just never can get enough in the way of knowledge. These folks see the world map tattoos as a reminder of all the locations in this world that need to be explored.</p><p><a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/"><strong>World Map Tattoo</strong></a></p><p>When inked with the world map, each time a new language is learned, a country is explored, or civilization is studied, the region can be inked in a unique color that is coded to a reference key beneath the map.</p><p>Those who live on the high seas utilize maps. Each day and the world map tattoos remind them of the journeys. Of the past and ones that are still on the horizon.</p><p>The tattoo design can be split in half so one-half appears on one foot. The other half on the other foot, symbolic of walking the earth one step at a time. Some split the tattoo design between two friends, lovers, or partners. A reference to being separated now but someday together in the same location again.</p><p>Many have to deal with being apart from the ones they love on a daily basis. And have created a unique way to keep them close at hand. The world map tattoos allow wearers to precisely show on the map where this person is. And it feels like a relatively shorter distance when compared to where you are today.</p><p>The tattoo offers some the ability to feel at one with the other person. Being all on the same planet, only separated by a few miles of water. Others choose these tattoo designs as a reminder of home, having moved away from their birthplace for work, school. Or to live abroad with their new family.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/map-tattoo/">Map Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The&nbsp;Symbol of Chaos&nbsp;originates from Michael Moorcock’s Eternal Champion stories. … In contrast, the&nbsp;symbol&nbsp;of Law is a single upright arrow. It is also called the Arms of&nbsp;Chaos, the Arrows of&nbsp;Chaos, the&nbsp;Chaos&nbsp;Star, the&nbsp;Chaos&nbsp;Cross, the Chaosphere, or the&nbsp;Symbol&nbsp;of Eight.While the peace sign is a highly recognizable symbol, there are many ways that people who wear it can add variety to it and make it a more personal image. People with friends or family in the military will add a yellow ribbon or dog tags to signify their military connection. A peace sign can also represent that a person who is going through a rocky transformation or a tumultuous time is keeping their mind focused on the goal. Drawing around the peace sign or within the peace sign also turns the symbol into something more meaningful. Often people will request the flag of a country or a dove to make the picture more meaningful.</p><p>A peace sign can also represent that a person who is going through a rocky transformation or a tumultuous time is keeping their mind focused on the goal. Drawing around the peace sign or within the peace sign also turns the symbol into something more meaningful. Often people will request the flag of a country or a dove to make the picture more meaningful.</p><p>Peace symbol tattoos can actually be a request for two different types of&nbsp;designs.</p><p>This request ether means the circle with the vertical line splitting into three forks or the human hand holding up the index and the middle finger with the thumb overlaid across the ring and pinky fingers; not with the back side of the hand showing. This has a completely different meaning in different parts of the world.</p><p><a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/"><strong>Chaos Tattoo</strong></a></p><p>Inner peace tattoos are calming and relaxing and have several meanings. General inner peace represents a state of spiritual and mental peace.</p><p>There is no single design or rule to live with here. Some symbols that you can use to represent peace include Yin Yang, Buddha, lotus, peace, and flowers.</p><p>Tribal peace sign tattoos are among the most popular <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">peace sign designs</a>. The tattoos are inked in many variations mostly portrayed alone or linked with other elements and symbols. Men mostly wear the tattoos even though there are women who sport them.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/chaos-tattoo/">Chaos Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peony symbolizes wealth, good fortune, and prosperity. Peony is a strong symbol of beauty, fragility and transitory nature of existence. Furthermore, they depict that getting great rewards is only possible by taking great risks.</p><p>When you combine the beauty of a&nbsp;flower with the edginess of a wrist tattoo you have a winning combination for a feminine and unique design. Flower tattoos remain a popular choice for many reasons.</p><p>Adding to their obvious beauty is the individual meanings of the flowers. Some flowers represent love and friendship, while others have associations of new life and peace. While their personal significance may remain a secret, their beauty can be shared with others. Whether you adore a certain blossom for its true beauty or appreciate the sentiment behind it, the following wrist tattoo ideas are perfect for brainstorming your first or next petaled tattoo.</p><p>The pairing is known as Karajishi and the lion’s ferocity is tempered by the peony’s beauty.</p><p><strong>Peony Tattoo</strong></p><p>Peony is a flower with a deep history of veneration and cultivation for many centuries. For example in China and Japan, the peony is a symbolic floral with similar meaning to the lotus, chrysanthemum and cherry blossom.</p><p>Peony is a symbol of wealth. Also remember that in China and Japan people used stone lions to guard sacred places, homes, Palaces, and temples and therefore the peony and the lion combination are not accidental.</p><p>Peony can be placed as a tattoo design in various way. They may portray the peony flower alone or combined with other elements and symbols. Peony was&nbsp;deep red in color as a tattoo design. Over time, the tattoo designs changed to include peonies in shades of orange, white, yellow and pink.</p><p>Furthermore, Peony flower tattoos may portray purple and blue color. As a result, you should be able to select the color that you want.</p><p>If you are more into color symbolism, you should be able to select a color that will represent you.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/peony-tattoo/">Flower wrist band tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">Tattoos</a>&nbsp;have different connotations and the owl tattoo meaning is just among such. As a bird, the owl has been linked to many things useful in giving the best meaning to your owl tattoo. Different cultures have attached different meanings to the owl tattoo. Some of the cultures that have found interest in the owl are the Egyptian, Celtic, and Hindu among others.</p><p>The ancient Greeks revered the goddess Athena, who was supposed to be the goddess of&nbsp;<strong>wisdom</strong>&nbsp;and guardian of the Acropolis. Her symbol was the owl, so the bird became a symbol of higher&nbsp;<strong>wisdom</strong>. The owl was a bird of prophecy and wisdom&nbsp;in many ancient cultures</p><p><strong>Symbol of wisdom, education, and intelligence</strong></p><p>Undeniably, the owl is a carrier of many symbols. However, this is not a big surprise because the bird’s appearance is unique. It is rarely seen especially during the day. Mostly, it can be found at night, and therefore the beliefs can be many. It represents something precious that is not easily found but through a struggle and great search.</p><p><a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/"><strong>Owl Tattoo</strong></a></p><p>The owl tattoo is a complicated and beautiful work of design that is very much appealing to the eye. For a long time now, the owl tattoo symbolism is connected to education and wisdom.&nbsp;The Native Americans believe the owl to be the protector of sacred knowledge, hence regard it as a symbol of intelligence.</p><p><strong>Symbol of freedom and vision</strong></p><p>Just like the beliefs that birds are known to be free by flying wherever they please, the owl tattoo can symbolize freedom.</p><p>The owl with its big eyes is a great hunter. It is known to look for its food in an organized quiet manner even when flapping its wings. An owl tattoo will thus be used to symbolize vision.&nbsp;Weather forecasters of ancient times used the owl in their work. It was also useful in telling important weather conditions for different seasons.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/owl-tattoo/">Owl Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though the designs are plenty, their symbolism in nature is subtle in their essence. There are always deeper meanings hidden between the lines of nature in the real life. And you should, therefore, try to do some research to understand the meaning of each design you intend to ink on your body.</p><p>Today, we can also take our cue from the forebears. We have powerful tools for psychic growth among the seas, skies and the trees. At every turn, our intuitive eyes feast upon the nature surrounding us, elevates us and most importantly transports our potentially transcendental perception.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">Minimalist Tattoo</a>, Nature symbolism has no limit.</strong></p><p>And therefore, there are no set limits to the spiritual growth, higher knowledge, and the profound unfolding. You can come up with a tattoo design by recognizing what surrounds you.</p><p>You will remain with the tattoo design for the rest of your life. And therefore you have to clearly understand what you want to get. Whether you intend to go for <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">nature tattoos</a>, or any other type, research on it and know whether you will be comfortable with it in some years to come.</p><p>Furthermore, think about the significance of the tattoo design on you.</p><p>If you have fallen in and out of similar designs in the past.</p><p>Then wait for some time before having it inked on you.</p><p>But if you are thinking about something that symbolizes or has ever given you hope in tough times, then you should decisively go for it.</p><p>It is a popular design since it paints the picture of what trees symbolizes. Trees are strong support systems for our abundant life.</p><p>Trees symbolize strong system for the abundant life and fruitful existence which begets vitality and means to continue.</p><p>The mighty oak tree design is a mighty decorative piece and has a rifer meaning than the palm tree. It is among the most long-lasting tattoo designs in the human race. In ancient times, individuals used the tree for religious purposes and it is also considered to be a feature of courage.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/minimalistic-tattoo/">Minimalistic Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
