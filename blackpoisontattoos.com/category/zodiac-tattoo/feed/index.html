										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sagittarius is the 9th sign that features in the zodiac wheel. It is also among the final 3 fire signs of the zodiac collection. It is mostly represented by an archer or the symbol of an archer. This archer will have a bow and an arrow and will be joined to a horse.</p><p><strong>Sagittarius Zodiac that shows half a person and half horse.</strong></p><p>The body of the human being is what will replace the head of the horse, but the other part is complete of a horse. The sign also represents people born between November the 23rd and December the 21st.</p><p>The Sagittarius sign or character can be applied on the body and they represent pried, passion, fury, courage, and independence.</p><p>The wearer of the tattoo will most likely have these personalities.</p><p>They are also persons that can face any sort of challenge, without fear.<br>
All of us are possessive about our identity and it means a lot to us. We express it in different ways and the sun sign tattoos are also a way of expressing our identity. People who belong to the Sagittarius sun sign are natural tattoo lovers as they are blessed with an artistic bent of mind. They love to explore and research and are also very fiery and straight-forward. The Sagittarius tattoos are best for conveying the fact that one was born under the ninth sign of the zodiac and is ruled by the fire element.</p><p>The tattoo has got a very sexy display and stands out from all other sun signs tattoos. The centaur and the archer represent the Sagittarians. The arrow is the symbol of the ardent and passionate sun sign. Men and women love both the designs. Those who want a simple and cute look generally go for the symbol while the ones wishing for an elaborate and catchy display choose the centaur and the archer.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/sagittarius-zodiac-sign-tattoo/">Sagittarius Zodiac Sign Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
