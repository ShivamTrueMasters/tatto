										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Until the very end&#8221; is a quote from Deathly Hallows. Harry&#8217;s walking to his death and uses the Resurrection Stone to bring back the people who meant the most to him. When he asks if they&#8217;ll stay with him, James replies, &#8220;Until the very end.&#8221;</p><p><a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/"><strong>Harry Potter Tattoo</strong></a></p><p>The Deathly Hallows <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">symbol</a> is a simple representation of the Deathly Hallows artifacts: the Elder Wand, the resurrection stone and the invisibility cloak. The symbol consists of triangle, with a circle inside it. A straight line bisects the circle and the top of the triangle.</p><p><strong>The triangle represents the cloak; the circle represents the resurrection stone; and the straight line represents the Elder Wand.</strong></p><p>The brothers are skilled wizards who unite their powers to cross a river, where Death usually claims victims. Death schemes to trick them by offering each a gift. The eldest brother asks for an unbeatable wand, so the second brother asks for the power to raise the dead, and the final brother asks for an invisibility cloak. Death claims the first two brothers, but the youngest brother lives until he is ready to take off the cloak and reveal himself to Death.</p><p>The Hallows united would supposedly make the person who owns them the master of Death itself. The myth, as Hermione reads it in&nbsp;<i>Beedle the Bard</i>, has a basis in fact. The three Peverell brothers, according to Dumbledore, were exceedingly talented magicians who created the objects themselves.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/harry-potter-tattoo/">Until The Very End</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>“In photography there is a reality so subtle that it becomes more real than reality.”</strong></p><p>Ninety years ago, at the 1925 Leipzig Spring Fair in Germany, a <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">camera</a> was launched that was destined to change the face of photography. This was a time when it was still common for glass plates to be used in cameras, and those that took roll film were thought of as miniatures. So imagine the culture shock when a still photography camera was produced to take 35mm movie film.</p><p>The Leica was by no means the first 35mm camera, but it was the first to make 35mm truly viable, leading to the most popular film format ever.</p><p><strong>Once photographing meant a large box camera on a tripod, shifting film plate after each shot &#8211; &amp; working with a dark cloth over your head and the Camera Tattoo.</strong></p><p><strong>But then something happened&#8230;</strong></p><p>The Leica was extremely compact &amp; could be fitted with a very high-quality lens. That enabled photographers to work in ordinary outdoor settings with available light. It was always instantly ready to capture life and action effortlessly. From any angle with the photographer often able to remain unnoticed.</p><p>Oskar Barnack was headhuntet from Carl Zeiss to be the manager of the Research &amp; Development Department at Leitz. He became the designer of the Ur-Leica which he made two (possibly three) samples of in the period 1912-1913. With the purpose to test film stock and/or lenses for movie films. Or perhaps because he couldn&#8217;t carry the traditional large plate cameras and wanted a smaller camera for him self. Barnack was a film geek and moving pictures was the new revolution back in early 1900&#8217;s.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/camera-tattoo/">Camera Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Embrace the Duality of Life and Death with an Eye &amp; Skull Trash Polka Tattoo</strong></p><p>The world of tattoos offers a vast canvas for self-expression, and the combination of an eye and a skull in the trash polka style is a captivating choice for those seeking a design that&#8217;s both bold and symbolic. This unique style, characterized by bold blacks, contrasting reds, and a chaotic yet balanced composition, perfectly complements the intriguing nature of the eye and skull imagery.</p><p><strong>The Allure of the Eye &amp; Skull</strong></p><p>The eye is a universal symbol of seeing, knowledge, and truth. It can represent deep intuition, watchfulness, or a spiritual connection. In contrast, the skull signifies mortality, impermanence, and the cycle of life and death. When juxtaposed, these contrasting symbols create a powerful image that reflects on the duality of existence.</p><p><strong>Trash Polka: A Style for the Bold</strong></p><p>Trash polka, originating in Germany, is a distinctive tattoo style known for its rebellious spirit. It incorporates bold, graphic elements like splatters, drips, and brushstrokes, often alongside realistic imagery. This creates a visually striking and in-your-face aesthetic that perfectly complements the edgy symbolism of the eye and skull.</p><p><strong>Designing Your Eye &amp; Skull Trash Polka Tattoo</strong></p><p>There&#8217;s no limit to the creativity you can bring to your eye and skull trash polka tattoo. Here are some elements to consider:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Eye Detail:</strong>&nbsp;Will your eye be realistic or more stylized? Will it be open, closed, or weeping?</li>

<li><strong>Skull Style:</strong>&nbsp;A classic human skull, a more anatomical depiction, or even an animal skull can be incorporated.</li>

<li><strong>Composition:</strong>&nbsp;How will the eye and skull interact? Will they be intertwined, or will one dominate the design?</li>

<li><strong>Additional Elements:</strong>&nbsp;Consider incorporating other symbolic elements like flames, roses, or script to personalize your tattoo further.</li></ul><p><strong>Finding the Right Artist</strong></p><p>A skilled and experienced tattoo artist who specializes in trash polka is crucial for achieving a stunning and impactful result. Look for an artist with a strong portfolio showcasing their trash polka work and discuss your vision in detail before committing to the design.</p><p><strong>Embrace the Power of Duality</strong></p><p>An eye and skull trash polka tattoo is a conversation starter, a symbol of introspection, and a bold statement about embracing life&#8217;s complexities. With careful planning and the expertise of a talented artist, this design can become a cherished piece of body art.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/eye-skull-tattoo-in-realistic-trash-polka-type-tattoo-2/">Eye and Skull: A Hauntingly Beautiful Trash Polka Tattoo Design</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
