The lion on his index finger is wearing a crown and holding an arrow. This tattoo symbolizes the king of the jungle, Simba from The Lion King. Simba is strong and courageous like this lion, so it makes sense that this one was inspired by him! His middle finger tattoo is actually a tribute to another character from The Lion King: Rafiki (who portrayed as Mufasa&#8217;s spirit). Rafiki means &#8220;friend&#8221; or &#8220;one who encourages&#8221; in Swahili—a fitting description for this wise old baboon who helps Simba find his way back home after he runs away from Pride Rock because he doesn&#8217;t want to be king yet! Where they&#8217;re located: These two tattoos are located right above Ed’s knuckles near his wrist on his left hand. What do they mean?: They show how much Ed loves Disney movies about animals interacting with each other—and maybe also how much he enjoys being part of an animal kingdom himself! He also seems really happy now that he has these permanent reminders of fun times spent watching movies with friends after school when we were younger&#8230;</p><div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-celebrities-really-do-get-tattoos">Celebrities really do get tattoos..</h4><p>You may be surprised to learn that celebrities really do get tattoos.

Well, it&#8217;s a way to express themselves and make a statement about who they are and what they believe in. Tattoos can be fun, artistic, meaningful—or all three at once!

Some tattoos are simple designs that have no deeper significance, but others tell stories about love lost or family members who have passed away. It&#8217;s always interesting to learn about why stars choose these kinds of permanent body art as opposed to other forms such as piercings or temporary tattoos that can be removed if need be!</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/celebrity-tattoos/">10 Celebrity Tattoos With Exact Meanings Behind Them &#8211; Photos</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
