										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meaning of the Gladiator Warrior Tattoo for men is quite obvious, and it is known to every young man who once watched the eponymous film with Russell Crowe. The word itself derives from the Latin word “gladius”, which is translated as “sword”.</p><p>In those distant times, gladiators were enslaved people, slaves or soldiers and criminals taken prisoners during the battles. All of them were previously taught how to handle the sword correctly.</p><p><strong>Gladiator Warrior Tattoo</strong></p><p>As soon as gladiators got the necessary skills, they were confronted with each other. Such massacres resulted in the death of one of them. The bloody battles in Ancient Rome had been held in arenas for seven hundred years.&nbsp;At first, the Romans preferred to arrange such fights on holidays.</p><p>They wanted to satisfy the cruel <a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/513128951295246140/">god</a> of war Mars in such a way. Over time, they began to hold such battles for entertainment without much reason. The Romans borrowed offering up sacrifices in the form of gladiatorial games from the Egyptians, Etruscans, and Greeks. </p><p>Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/blog/">Roman world</a>.</p><p>The war in Samnium, immediately afterwards, was attended with equal danger and an equally glorious conclusion. The enemy, besides their other warlike preparation, had made their battle-line to glitter with new and splendid arms. There were two corps: the shields of the one were inlaid with gold, of the other with silver&nbsp;&#8230;</p><p> The Romans had already heard of these splendid accoutrements, but their generals had taught them that a soldier should be rough to look on, not adorned with gold and silver but putting his trust in iron and in courage&nbsp;&#8230;So the Romans made use of the splendid armour of their enemies to do honour to their gods; while the Campanians, in consequence of their pride and in hatred of the Samnites, equipped after this fashion the gladiators who furnished them entertainment at their feasts, and bestowed on them the name Samnites</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/gladiator-warrior-tattoo/">Gladiator Warrior Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The History of the Dove Symbol</strong></p><p>The dove ranks as one of the most widely-known symbols around the world, universally representing peace and love. Due to the symbol’s wide recognition, these tattoos are popular all around the globe.</p><p><strong>The dove embodies a variety of positive meanings.</strong></p><p><strong>Enduring Love</strong>. Because doves mate with one partner for the duration of their lives and also take care of their young together, they represent steadfast love and devotion. The bond between the mated pair is a lifelong, enduring, and faithful partnership.</p><p><strong>Mythological Significance</strong>. The dove is also mentioned in Greek and Roman mythology: the Greek goddess Aphrodite, the goddess of love and fertility, was said to ride in a chariot borne by doves. Her seven daughters (known as the Pleiades) are referred to as a flock of doves in Greek mythology. Some tribes believed that the spirits of the dead are transformed into doves. Some American Indians may use the dove tattoo to represent this association.</p><p><strong>Dove and Rose Tattoo</strong></p><p><strong>Peace and Harmony.</strong>&nbsp;Since early Christianity, the dove holding an olive branch in its beak has represented a symbol of peace. Ironically, the image of a dove holding a grenade has become quite popular as well.</p><p><strong>Holy Spirit.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p> Many examples of Christian art depict Jesus accompanied by a flock of doves. Doves are mentioned often in the Bible, for example in the story of Noah&#8217;s Ark. Before the great flood, God ordered Noah to build a ark for him and his family and to gather all the animals in pairs, one male and one female. God then flooded the earth and everything was destroyed. After several weeks at sea, Noah sent out a dove and a raven to look for signs of land. When the dove returned with an olive branch in its beak, this was a sign that life would start over.</p><p><strong>The Messenger</strong>. There are many stories about the dove carrying messages, sometimes messages from God, sometimes love letters. <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/513128951289302847/?nic=1">https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/513128951289302847/?nic=1</a></p><p><strong>Peace and Harmony.</strong>&nbsp;Since early Christianity, the dove holding an olive branch in its beak has represented a symbol of peace.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Amazing Cover Up Tattoo with Lord Buddha Tattoo!</strong></p><p>Buddha and Lotus tattoo can symbolize purity. Apart from the message, the 3D effect makes your Buddha tattoo look realistic; a perfect design to wear on your sleeves.</p><p>Buddhism is one of the most common and most colorful religions there is in the present world. Within this religions are a variety of traditions and beliefs that followers of Gautama Buddha believe in. But apart from being a religion and a philosophy, Buddhism and Buddha have become one of the most popular subjects in tattoos. We can clearly see the reason why. Buddha tattoos often emanates a sense of peace and serenity. Apart from that, Buddha tattoos are clearly a fantastic choice among religious tattoos.</p><p>Buddha tattoos are regarded as sacred and must be inked after a great deal of consideration and careful selection of design as they stand for one’s belief, rather than the beauty and charm normally associated with tattoos. Dragon, phoenix, fish, lion, elephant, wolf, owl, celestial objects stars, moon, birds and many other elements such as flowers, dreamcatchers, feathers, anchors, arrows, compass, musical symbols, heart, infinity symbol, trees can also be used to enhance the Buddha tattoo designs or it depends on the bearer.</p><p><strong>Teachings of Buddhism</strong></p><p>Buddha was born as a prince and known by the name of&nbsp;<strong>Siddhartha Gautama.</strong>&nbsp;Until one day, he decided to renounce all the comforts of his princely life to find the real truth. About human existence, He reached the state of enlightenment by deep meditation. And severe penance and taught his followers the true path to attaining salvation.The image of a Buddha is a representation of the intricate path of Buddhist beliefs and ritual, a tribute to the concepts of universal peace emphasized by the first Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama.</p><p>The Laughing Buddha, known as Budai, is a rotund, smiling image of a large, bald man who often carries a cloth sack. Obviously, those who both want a Buddha tattoo and a tattoo that represents luck will probably pick the Laughing Buddha over the others. They could also decide to get it if they are very positive people that love laughter in their lives.</p><p><strong>Buddha Tattoo Design</strong></p><p>Shakyamuni, the title of the first Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, is a slender man with curly hair, often depicted in gold or another expensive material. His universal compassion is immediately associated with his image. People who get the Shakyamuni Buddha tattoo often want to emulate Siddhartha in every way that they can. They see doing for others as one of the most fulfilling things in life.</p><p>The Buddha is also a representation of protection. The image of Buddha, in this way, serves as a guardian. Protection tattoos come in many forms, but the Buddha tattoo is moving up the ranks. Thanks to the fact that more people are getting larger tattoos these days. Not only that, this Buddha tattoo meaning&nbsp; is a bit more clear than others, which makes it a great pick for some people.</p><p>With all of these very strong Buddha tattoo meanings, it should come as no surprise. That this is a very popular tattoo right now. As is the case with many multi-meaning tattoos. people who get the Buddha tattoo can attach one meaning when they get the tat and more meanings later on. Or, of course, you can decide to get a Buddha tattoo simply because you like the way that it looks and you can find a meaning in it in the future.</p><p>Gautama proclaimed the virtue of self-discipline and nonviolence through spiritual meditation. Some people decide to get a Siddhartha Buddha tattoo over other popular Buddha tattoo designs. Buddha stands for the enlightenment which every human being looks for, to adds a new meaning to their life. The image of the face of Buddha makes a wonderful design option in Buddha tattoo. As it represents the ultimate calmness and serenity.</p><p>‪#‎lordbuddhatattoo‬ ‪#‎buddhatattoo‬ ‪#‎religioustattoos‬ ‪#‎religioustattoo‬ ‪#‎3dtattoo‬ ‪#‎lotustattoo‬ ‪#‎coveruptattoo‬ ‪#‎buuddhism‬ ‪#‎gautamabuddhatattoo‬ ‪#‎lordgautambuddhatattoo‬</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/buddha-tattoo-design/">Amazing Cover Up Tattoo with Lord Buddha Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
