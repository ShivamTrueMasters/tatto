										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">The significance<b>&nbsp;of Crescent Moon on Lord Shiva’s Head</b></a></p><p>Shiva Tattva is where there is no mind and the moon signifies the mind. When there is no mind then how can this ‘no-mindedness’ be expressed and how can anybody understand it? You need a little bit of the mind to understand, experience and to express.<br>The no-mind, infinite consciousness requires that little bit of mind to express itself in the manifest world. So, to express that inexpressible, that little mind (crescent moon) is on the head.<br>Wisdom is beyond the mind, but it needs to be expressed with a tinge of mind and this is symbolized by the crescent moon.</p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/blog/"><b>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Damru</b></a></p><p><b>Damru</b> symbolizes the Universe which is always expanding and collapsing. From an expansion, it collapses and then it re-expands, this is the process of creation.<br>If you see your heartbeat, it is not just one straight line but it is a rhythm that goes up and down. The whole world is nothing but rhythms; energy rising and collapsing to rise again. So the damru signifies that. Look at the shape of the damru, from expansion it collapses and again expands.</p><p>The&nbsp;darmru&nbsp;is also a symbol of sound. Sound is rhythm and sound is energy. The whole universe is nothing but a wave function, it is nothing but rhythms. What does quantum physics say? It says the same thing – the whole universe is nothing but rhythms. It is just one wave (Adviata). So the&nbsp;damru&nbsp;signifies the non-dual nature of the universe.</p><p><b>Significance of Serpent around Lord Shiva’s Neck</b></p><p>A state of samadhi where there is nothing, just the inner sky of consciousness, is Shiva; where there is alertness and no action. To describe this alertness they put a snake around Shiva’s neck. So the&nbsp;<b>serpent</b>&nbsp;is a symbol of&nbsp;<b>alertness</b>.</p><p>In the state of meditation when the eyes are closed, it gives the impression that the person is sleeping, but he is not asleep, he is alert. To express this state of consciousness, a&nbsp;<b>snake</b>&nbsp;is shown around Lord Shiva’s neck.</p><p><b>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Trishul (Trident)</b></p><p><b>Trishul</b> represents the three aspects of consciousness – waking, dreaming and sleeping, and it represents the three Gunas – satva, rajas and tamas. Holding a Trishul (Trident) signifies that Shiva (the divinity) is above all the three states – waking, dreaming and sleeping, yet is the upholder of these three states.<br>The divinity is beyond the three gunas, but it holds the three Gunas together.</p><p><b>Shul</b> means problems or suffering. <b>Trishul</b> means that which destroys all kinds of suffering.</p><p><strong>Three types of pain that arise in life:</strong></p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Aadibhautik (physical)</li><li>Aadhyaatmik (spiritual) and</li><li>Aadidaivik (ethereal)</li></ol><p>What relieves you from all the problems and suffering is the Trishul. And it is in the hand of Shiva.</p><p>Also, view our large portfolio of <a href="/portfolio_category/lord-shiva-tattoos/">Shiva Tattoos</a>.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/shiva-tattoo-on-chest/">Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Waterfall Legend</strong></p><p>Koi is a Japanese word for Carp. Japanese people have, for years, used Koi fish tattoo designs as a cultural symbol for overcoming adversity. Stories are told of how they climb waterfalls that have strong currents.One particular legend is the koi fish’s claim to fame. An ancient tale tells of a huge school of golden koi swimming upstream the Yellow River in China.</p><p>Gaining strengt<span class="text_exposed_show">h by fighting against the current, the school glimmered as they swam together through the river. When they reached a waterfall at the end of the river, many of the koi turned back, letting the flow of the river carry them away.The remaining koi refused to give up. Leaping from the depths of the river, they attempted to reach the top of the waterfall to no avail. Their efforts caught the attention of local demons, who mocked their efforts and heightened the waterfall out of malice. After a hundred years of jumping, one koi finally reached the top of the waterfall.</span></p><p><strong>Koi Fish Meaning</strong></p><p>The koi fish is a symbol with extremely deep meaning for those who choose it as part of their body art. If you have been considering getting a tattoo that involves a koi fish, take the time first to learn the meaning associated with them. The traditional significance of a koi fish tattoo can vary depending on the fish’s orientation (whether it is going up or down your body) and color. You want to be sure that your koi fish tattoo conveys the desired meaning.</p><p>Koi fish have a very long history in Chinese and Japanese culture. They were originally common carp and were later domesticated and bred to produce certain colors. Chinese invaders brought koi to Japan, where the fish flourished. Koi fish are prominent in the work of Japanese tattoo artists because of a long-standing legend of how the fish become dragons. Most of the meaning and symbolism behind the fish stems from this ancient legend.</p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">The gods recognized the koi for its perseverance and determination and turned it into a golden dragon. The image of power and strength. However, the Annunaki (in chariots of gods tattoo), an age of Pisces and dragons.</span><span class="text_exposed_show"><br>

I remember there is a sentence is “When the mind and hands are silenced the spirit is more focused”. There are many different meanings staying inside each tattoo. We have it to commemorate a member of the family, a relative, a friend or a person you admire who passed away. We have it to mark and raise ourselves up in hard periods in our life. Sometimes, we have it to just praying for the happiness and the health of our family. In general, the religious belief and comfort are what people aim in life.</p><p>God gave a gift to the world when you were born&#8230;Praying Hands In God&#8217;s hands lies a heart, a life that changed the world&nbsp;<strong>Praying hands symbolize obedience, submission, sincerity, repentance, veneration, and respect in regard to one&#8217;s higher power.</strong> The exact meaning of praying hands varies depending on which religious tradition is considered.</p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/"><strong>Praying hands tattoos Design Variations of the Tattoo</strong></a></p><p>The praying hands tattoo works well alone.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoo of Lord Shiva in Meditation</p><p><strong>Lord Shiva the Enigmatic</strong></p><p>According to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva is the Destroyer in the Holy Trinity, the others being Brahma the Creator and Vishnu the Preserver. He has always fascinated his followers by his unique appearance – he has not two but three eyes, has ash smeared all over his body, leads a wild life away from social pretences, and is known for his proverbial anger…but not many know the story about how he was born…</p><p><strong>So, how was Shiva born?</strong></p><p>There is a very interesting story behind the birth of Lord Shiva. One day, Brahma and Vishnu were both arguing about which of them was more powerful. Right then, one great blazing pillar appeared, whose roots and branches extended into the earth and sky, beyond view.</p><p><strong>The Third Power</strong></p><p>Both Brahma and Vishnu set out to locate the start and end of that pillar. Brahma turned into a goose and flew up to find the top of the pillar, while Vishnu turned into a boar and dug into the earth to look for its roots. After their unsuccessful attempt, both came back to find Lord Shiva emerging from an opening in the pillar. Recognising Shiva’s great power, they both accepted that besides them, there was a third power ruling over the universe.</p><p><strong>Lord Shiva’s Lifestyle</strong></p><p>But Lord Shiva is no ordinary god. He is a very complex god, having many roles to play and possessing immense power. His favourite haunt are cemeteriesand his favourite dress code is a headdress of snakes and a necklace of skulls. He is accompanied by a band of terrifying looking demons, who are blood-thirsty as well.</p><p><strong>Lord Shiva’s Meditative Powers</strong></p><p>Though Shiva is known better as a ferocious god, he has another side too – he is known to spend long periods of time in deep meditation in the lofty Himalayas.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong>&nbsp;#LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-shiva-in-meditation/">Lord Shiva in Meditation</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>3D Star Tattoo with Nice Words Inked by Black Poison Tattoos</p><p>Some nice words like friendship, freedom, family, love, and more are inserted into a large 3D star Tattoo.</p><p>Star tattoos can be nice and unique delegate of your inner personality and conviction. Star tattoo designs look cool and they are a good preference for a very first ink piece because a star is typically small in design and doesn’t need to be awfully intricate. These designs look attractive and generally they signify a change in life.</p><p>The star is one of the oldest classical cryptograms and it has been an important image in many cultures and religions. When human knew nothing about them, what actually they are, still they were very lovable by human. In the ancient times, human stared up at the sky and attempted to explain that superlative view with the help of myths and religion.</p><p>They are universal cryptograms, not attached to an exact religion or culture, and actually can mean plenty of unique things to plenty of unique people. Male and females have separate star tattoos designs prearranged for them. Females love the shooting stars since they look very feminine, whereas guys love the nautical stars since they look manly. Star tattoos can be drawn as a single star, solitary star, or as an assemblage of small stars, celestial, or nautical designs.</p><p>Star tattoos designs are very flexible and can mesh up with wings, skulls, moon &amp; sun, scroll, flowers, butterfly, fairy and we think almost every kind of image or symbol can be mesh up with stars with the aim of generating a unique and personal tattoo. If you are looking for unique star tattoos not those common or creepy designs.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/3d-star-tattoo/">3D Star Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
