										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos are a deeply personal expression, and for many, they hold spiritual significance. One of the most awe-inspiring designs gaining popularity in the tattoo world is the fusion of <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong>, the <strong>Shivling</strong>, and <strong>Ram-Ram chants</strong>. This divine combination is not only visually powerful but also packed with spiritual symbolism, making it a meaningful choice for those looking to honor their faith and devotion.</p><p>In this blog, we‚Äôll explore the significance of this fusion tattoo, what each element represents, and why it‚Äôs an amazing design choice for anyone looking to blend faith and art.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-symbolism-behind-each-element">The Symbolism Behind Each Element</h3><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-lord-hanuman">1. <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong></h4><p>Lord Hanuman, one of the most revered deities in Hinduism, is the epitome of strength, devotion, and loyalty. Known as the mighty monkey god, he played a pivotal role in the <strong>Ramayana</strong>, serving as Lord Rama‚Äôs most loyal devotee. Hanuman is also seen as the protector, someone who guards against evil forces. His inclusion in a tattoo is often a mark of protection, courage, and immense dedication to a higher power.</p><p>For those who look to embody his fearless spirit, strength, and unwavering devotion, a Hanuman tattoo is a powerful symbol. Many designs capture him in his most iconic form‚Äîholding a mountain or ripping open his chest to reveal Lord Rama and Sita inside, showcasing his deep devotion.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-shivling">2. <strong>Shivling</strong></h4><p>The <strong>Shivling</strong> represents the infinite power and energy of <strong>Lord Shiva</strong>, the destroyer of evil and transformer of the universe. It signifies the balance of creation and destruction, serving as a reminder of life‚Äôs cyclical nature. For many, the Shivling is a powerful representation of their connection to the universe and their desire to remain in harmony with nature.</p><p>In tattoo designs, the Shivling is often depicted with vibrant shading and intricate detail, symbolizing Lord Shiva‚Äôs cosmic energy. It pairs beautifully with Lord Hanuman, as Hanuman is often considered an incarnation or devotee of Lord Shiva, thus blending their energies in one stunning design.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-ram-ram-chants">3. <strong>Ram-Ram Chants</strong></h4><p>The repeated chanting of <strong>‚ÄúRam-Ram‚Äù</strong> holds a unique place in the hearts of Hindu devotees. Lord Rama is the epitome of virtue and righteousness, and the continuous chanting of his name is believed to purify the soul and bring peace. Ram-Ram chants are often used in prayers and meditation as a form of devotion and mindfulness.</p><p>In tattoo art, these chants can be incorporated into the design in beautiful flowing scripts. The <strong>Devanagari script</strong>, in particular, is favored for its traditional look and adds a sense of spiritual depth to the tattoo. The repetitive mantra not only reinforces one‚Äôs devotion to Lord Rama but also serves as a constant reminder of inner peace and moral guidance.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-fusion-tattoo-is-powerful">Why This Fusion Tattoo is Powerful</h3><p>Combining <strong>Lord Hanuman, the Shivling, and Ram-Ram chants</strong> into a single tattoo creates a multi-dimensional piece of art that carries deep personal and spiritual meaning. Here&#8217;s why it&#8217;s such a compelling design:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Spiritual Significance</strong> ‚Äì Each element carries its weight of devotion, protection, and divine energy. Together, they create a strong visual and spiritual statement about the wearer‚Äôs faith.</li>

<li><strong>Personalized Design</strong> ‚Äì The fusion of these elements allows for a highly customized tattoo, as each aspect can be styled according to personal preferences‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs focusing more on Hanuman‚Äôs features or highlighting the flow of the chants around the Shivling.</li>

<li><strong>Symbol of Protection and Strength</strong> ‚Äì Hanuman‚Äôs presence symbolizes strength and loyalty, while the Shivling adds the element of cosmic energy and divine balance. The Ram-Ram chants tie the design together as a spiritual shield, protecting the wearer from negativity and evil forces.</li>

<li><strong>Cultural Reverence</strong> ‚Äì These symbols represent key deities and beliefs in Hinduism, making the tattoo a form of cultural homage. It connects the wearer to their roots and serves as a visual reminder of their spiritual journey.</li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-design-inspirations-and-ideas">Design Inspirations and Ideas</h3><p>If you‚Äôre considering getting this fusion tattoo, there are several creative ways to bring these elements together:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Backpiece Masterpiece</strong>: One popular approach is to make this tattoo a large backpiece, with Hanuman as the central figure, the Shivling below, and the Ram-Ram chants flowing around them. This style allows for detailed artistry and can convey a full narrative of devotion.</li>

<li><strong>Forearm or Sleeve Design</strong>: For those looking for a smaller or more compact version, a forearm tattoo can focus on Hanuman‚Äôs face, with the Shivling subtly incorporated and the Ram-Ram chants woven into the background. This design maintains clarity while using space efficiently.</li>

<li><strong>Minimalist Fusion</strong>: A minimalist approach could include a small Shivling with Hanuman‚Äôs face in silhouette form, with Ram-Ram chants delicately scripted around it. This design is ideal for those wanting a more subtle but deeply meaningful tattoo.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-key-considerations">Key Considerations</h3><p>When getting this tattoo, remember to:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Choose the Right Artist</strong>: Make sure your tattoo artist has experience with intricate designs and understands the spiritual significance behind these elements. You want the symbols to be respected and accurately depicted.</li>

<li><strong>Placement Matters</strong>: The placement of this tattoo can impact its visibility and size. Consider where you want to display this personal piece of art‚Äîwhether on a more private part of the body or prominently where others can admire it.</li>

<li><strong>Customization</strong>: Don‚Äôt be afraid to tweak the design to make it personal to you. Whether you want a more modern take on the Shivling or a detailed portrait of Hanuman, the design can be tailored to fit your vision.</li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3><p>A fusion tattoo of <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong>, the <strong>Shivling</strong>, and <strong>Ram-Ram chants</strong> is not just a body art choice; it‚Äôs a spiritual journey etched into your skin. This design is a beautiful homage to Hindu deities, encapsulating strength, protection, and devotion. Whether you&#8217;re deeply religious or simply admire the cultural significance, this tattoo can be a meaningful and visually stunning addition to your body art collection.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/the-ultimate-fusion-tattoo-lord-hanuman-shivling-and-ram-ram-chants/">The Ultimate Fusion Tattoo: Lord Hanuman, Shivling, and Ram-Ram Chants</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of Hindu symbolism offers a treasure trove of imagery for meaningful tattoos. Among these, the Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo stands out as a powerful representation of inner transformation and spiritual guidance. This blog post delves into the symbolism behind this unique design, exploring its historical significance and potential interpretations for the modern wearer.</p><p><strong>The Dance of Destruction and Renewal</strong></p><p>Shiva, the Hindu god of transformation, is often depicted in the ecstatic dance of Tandava. This cosmic dance represents the continual cycle of creation, destruction, and renewal within the universe. The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo frequently features Shiva in this dynamic pose, his body adorned with serpents and flames, symbolizing the transformative power he wields.</p><p><strong>The Guiding Presence of the Rishi</strong></p><p>Juxtaposed against Shiva&#8217;s energetic dance is the serene figure of a Rishi, a wise sage or seer. The Rishi acts as a counterpoint to Shiva&#8217;s dynamism, representing the wisdom and guidance needed to navigate the transformative process. In the tattoo, the Rishi is often depicted in a meditative posture, offering a sense of grounding and spiritual insight.</p><p><strong>Unveiling the Layers of Meaning</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo resonates with wearers on multiple levels. Here&#8217;s a deeper look at the symbolism it embodies:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Transformation and Rebirth:</strong> Shiva&#8217;s dance signifies the constant change inherent in life. By incorporating this image, the wearer acknowledges their own journey of growth and transformation.</li>

<li><strong>Inner Power and Destruction of Ego:</strong> The flames surrounding Shiva represent the burning away of illusion and ego. The tattoo serves as a reminder of the potential for immense inner power that lies within each of us.</li>

<li><strong>Seeking Guidance and Wisdom:</strong> The Rishi embodies the wisdom and knowledge needed to navigate life&#8217;s challenges. The tattoo signifies the wearer&#8217;s openness to guidance and spiritual growth.</li>

<li><strong>Balance and Duality:</strong> The contrasting figures of Shiva and the Rishi represent the inherent duality within the universe ‚Äì destruction and creation, chaos and order. The tattoo serves as a reminder of the importance of finding balance within oneself.</li></ul><p><strong>Beyond Symbolism: Personal Interpretations</strong></p><p>The beauty of the Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo lies in its ability to hold personal meaning for the wearer. Some interpretations include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>A Commitment to Spiritual Growth:</strong> The tattoo can symbolize a dedication to self-discovery and a willingness to embrace life&#8217;s transformative experiences.</li>

<li><strong>Overcoming Challenges:</strong> It can represent the courage to face inner demons and emerge stronger from difficult times.</li>

<li><strong>Honoring Lineage and Tradition:</strong> The Rishi can signify a connection to one&#8217;s spiritual lineage or a particular guru who has offered guidance.</li></ul><p><strong>Considering the Design</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo can be rendered in various artistic styles, from traditional Hindu art forms like Kolam or Madhubani to contemporary black and grey or vibrant illustrative styles. The choice of style ultimately depends on the wearer&#8217;s personal preferences and the desired level of detail.</p><p><strong>Placement and Size</strong></p><p>The size and placement of the tattoo can also hold significance. A larger, more elaborate design on the back or chest can represent a deep commitment to the symbolism, while a smaller, more discreet piece on the arm or ankle might offer a more personal reminder.</p><p><strong>Finding the Right Artist</strong></p><p>Given the intricate nature of the design, choosing a skilled tattoo artist with experience in Hindu iconography is crucial. Look for an artist who can capture the essence of the symbolism and translate it into a visually stunning and culturally respectful tattoo.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: A Powerful Talisman for Inner Transformation</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo is more than just a decorative piece of body art. It&#8217;s a powerful symbol that can serve as a constant reminder of the transformative potential within each of us. By understanding the rich symbolism behind this design, you can embark on a journey of self-discovery and embrace the power of inner transformation.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/shiva-rishi-tattoo/">Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Some individuals may choose a Ganesha tattoo because they appreciate the symbolism and meanings associated with Lord Ganesha, regardless of their religious affiliation.</li>

<li><strong>Can I get a Ganesha tattoo even if I am not religious?</strong> Yes, you can certainly get a Ganesha tattoo even if you are not religious. As mentioned earlier, many people opt for Ganesha tattoos because of the positive qualities and symbolism associated with Lord Ganesha, such as wisdom, intelligence, and the ability to overcome obstacles. The tattoo can be seen as a representation of these values, rather than solely as a religious symbol. People from various backgrounds choose Ganesha tattoos as a way to embrace the positive aspects represented by this deity.</li>

<li><strong>What are the best colors to use in a Ganesha tattoo?</strong> The choice of colors for a Ganesha tattoo can vary based on personal preferences and the tattoo artist&#8217;s style. However, traditional Ganesha tattoos often feature vibrant colors. Lord Ganesha is often depicted with a reddish or golden complexion. Some popular colors used in Ganesha tattoos include red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and gold. It&#8217;s essential to work with a skilled tattoo artist who can help you choose colors that complement the overall design and bring out the essence of the deity.</li>

<li><strong>Do Ganesha tattoos bring good luck?</strong> The belief in whether Ganesha tattoos bring good luck largely depends on an individual&#8217;s faith and cultural background. In Hinduism, Ganesha is revered as a deity who removes obstacles and brings blessings, so having a Ganesha tattoo may be seen as a way to seek his protection and favor. However, from a non-religious perspective, some people may consider the tattoo to represent positive qualities like wisdom, intellect, and determination, which could be seen as a source of inspiration or &#8220;good luck&#8221; in facing life&#8217;s challenges.</li></ol><p>Remember that getting a tattoo is a personal choice, and it&#8217;s essential to consider its meaning and significance to you before getting inked. It&#8217;s also a good idea to research tattoo artists and studios to ensure you get a high-quality and well-executed tattoo.</p><p>Remember, a Ganesha tattoo is not merely a piece of art; it is a spiritual journey that unlocks the gates to divine wisdom, providing guidance and strength to the spiritual souls who wear it with reverence.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/discover-the-mesmerizing-lord-ganesha-tattoo-for-spiritual-souls/">Discover the Mesmerizing Lord Ganesha Tattoo for Spiritual Souls</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">The significance<b> of Crescent Moon on Lord Shiva‚Äôs Head</b></a></p><p>Shiva Tattva is where there is no mind and the moon signifies the mind. When there is no mind then how can this ‚Äòno-mindedness‚Äô be expressed and how can anybody understand it? You need a little bit of the mind to understand, experience and to express.</p><p>The no-mind, infinite consciousness requires that little bit of mind to express itself in the manifest world. So, to express that inexpressible, that little mind (crescent moon) is on the head.<br>Wisdom is beyond the mind, but it needs to be expressed with a tinge of mind and this is symbolized by the crescent moon.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Lord Shiva‚Äôs Damru</strong></b></p><p><b>Damru</b>&nbsp;symbolizes the Universe which is always expanding and collapsing. From an expansion it collapses and then it re-expands, this is the process of creation.<br>If you see your heartbeat, it is not just one straight line but it is a rhythm that goes up and down. The whole world is nothing but rhythms; energy rising and collapsing to rise again. So the&nbsp;damru&nbsp;signifies that. Look at the shape of the&nbsp;damru, from expansion it collapses and again expands.</p><p>Lord shiva tattoo &#8211; The darmru is also a symbol of sound. Sound is rhythm and sound is energy. The whole universe is nothing but a wave function, it is nothing but rhythms. What does quantum physics say? It says the same thing ‚Äì the whole universe is nothing but rhythms. It is just one wave (Adviata). So the damru signifies the non-dual nature of the universe.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Serpent around Lord Shiva‚Äôs Neck</strong></b></p><p>A state of samadhi where there is nothing, just the inner sky of consciousness, is Shiva; where there is alertness and no action. To describe this alertness they put a snake around Shiva‚Äôs neck. So the&nbsp;<b>serpent</b>&nbsp;is a symbol of&nbsp;<b>alertness</b>.</p><p>In the state of meditation when the eyes are closed, it gives the impression that the person is sleeping, but he is not asleep, he is alert. To express this state of consciousness, a&nbsp;<b>snake</b>&nbsp;is shown around Lord Shiva‚Äôs neck.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Lord Shiva‚Äôs Trishul (Trident)-Lord shiva tattoo</strong></b></p><p><b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;represents the three aspects of consciousness ‚Äì waking, dreaming and sleeping, and it represents the three&nbsp;gunas ‚Äì satva, rajas&nbsp;and&nbsp;tamas. Holding a&nbsp;trishul&nbsp;(Trident) signifies that Shiva (the divinity) is above all the three states ‚Äì waking, dreaming and sleeping, yet is the upholder of these three states.<br>The divinity is beyond the three gunas, but it holds the three&nbsp;gunas&nbsp;together.</p><p><b>Shul</b>&nbsp;means problems or suffering.&nbsp;<b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;means that which destroys all kind of suffering.<br>Three types of pain that arise in life:<br>1.&nbsp;Aadibhautik&nbsp;(physical)<br>2.&nbsp;Aadhyaatmik&nbsp;(spiritual) and<br>3.&nbsp;Aadidaivik&nbsp;(ethereal)<br>What relieves you from all the problems and suffering is the&nbsp;trishul. And it is in the hand of Shiva.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/shiva-shakti-tattoo/">Shiva Shakti Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Born in northern India (around 3,228 BCE), Lord Krishna‚Äôs life marks the passing of the Dvapara age and beginning of the Kal yuga (which is also considered as the current age).Krishna Tattoo</p><p>References to Lord Krishna can be found in several Hindu mythological books, especially in the epic Hindu book, the Mahabharata.</p><p>Lord Krishna is also described as an important figure in the Bhagavata Purana. This is another Hindu epic book that dates to the 10th century B.C. In the text, Lord Krishna is described as the charioteer for the warrior Arjuna who had guided him morally and gave military counsel to the leader.</p><p>The divine birth</p><p>There came a time when Mother Earth was unable to bear the sins and cruelty committed by evil kings and rulers. Mother Earth then prayed to Lord Brahma, the creator of the Universe, to relieve her from these sinful kings. Lord Brahma prayed to the supreme Lord Vishnu for reincarnation and to relieve the Mother Earth from these evil rulers. Lord Vishnu accepted the request and assured to defeat tyrannical forces.</p><p>The ruler of Mathura, Kansa was one such evil king. He had a sister named Devaki, who was married to Vasudeva. The day Devaki and Vasudeva got married, a voice from the sky forecasted that Devaki&#8217;s eighth son will bring an end to Kansa‚Äôs rule and will kill him.Krishna Tattoo</p><p>Frightened Kansa held the couple. He then vowed that he will kill every child of Devaki and Vasudeva. Seeing their first seven children being killed by the cruel Kansa, the imprisoned couple feared giving birth to their eighth child.</p><p><strong>One night Lord Vishnu appeared before them.</strong></p><p>He told them that in the guise of their son, he will return and rescue them from Kansa&#8217;s autocracy.</p><p>The divine baby was born and the day he was born, Vasudeva found himself magically freed from prison. He ran away with the infant to a safer house and Lord Vishnu removed all the obstacles from Vasudeva&#8217;s path.</p><p>Vasudeva reached a house in Gokul, exchanged Lord Krishna with a new born girl of Yashoda and Nanda and returned to the prison with the girl child. As soon as Kansa came to know about the new-born, he again tried to kill the child. The infant ascends to the heavens and transformed into the goddess Yogamaya and said, &#8220;O foolish Kansa! What will you get by killing me? Your nemesis is already born.‚ÄùKrishna Tattoo</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">Krishna</a> was raised as a cowherd in Gokul and became a skilful musician. On his return to Mathura, he slayed Kansa and restored his father to power.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/krishna-tattoo-2/">Krishna Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">The significance<b> of Crescent Moon on Lord Shiva‚Äôs Head</b></a></p><p>Shiva Tattva is where there is no mind and the moon signifies the mind. When there is no mind then how can this ‚Äòno-mindedness‚Äô be expressed and how can anybody understand it? You need a little bit of the mind to understand, experience and to express.</p><p>The no-mind, infinite consciousness requires that little bit of mind to express itself in the manifest world. So, to express that inexpressible, that little mind (crescent moon) is on the head.<br>Wisdom is beyond the mind, but it needs to be expressed with a tinge of mind and this is symbolized by the crescent moon.</p><p><b>Significance of Lord Shiva‚Äôs Damru</b></p><p><b>Damru</b>&nbsp;symbolizes the Universe which is always expanding and collapsing. From an expansion it collapses and then it re-expands, this is the process of creation.<br>If you see your heartbeat, it is not just one straight line but it is a rhythm that goes up and down. The whole world is nothing but rhythms; energy rising and collapsing to rise again. So the&nbsp;damru&nbsp;signifies that. Look at the shape of the&nbsp;damru, from expansion it collapses and again expands.</p><p>Lord shiva tattoo &#8211; The darmru is also a symbol of sound. Sound is rhythm and sound is energy. The whole universe is nothing but a wave function, it is nothing but rhythms. What does quantum physics say? It says the same thing ‚Äì the whole universe is nothing but rhythms. It is just one wave (Adviata). So the damru signifies the non-dual nature of the universe.</p><p><b>Significance of Serpent around Lord Shiva‚Äôs Neck</b></p><p>A state of samadhi where there is nothing, just the inner sky of consciousness, is Shiva; where there is alertness and no action. To describe this alertness they put a snake around Shiva‚Äôs neck. So the&nbsp;<b>serpent</b>&nbsp;is a symbol of&nbsp;<b>alertness</b>.</p><p>In the state of meditation when the eyes are closed, it gives the impression that the person is sleeping, but he is not asleep, he is alert. To express this state of consciousness, a&nbsp;<b>snake</b>&nbsp;is shown around Lord Shiva‚Äôs neck.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><b>Significance of Lord Shiva‚Äôs Trishul (Trident)-Lord shiva tattoo</b></a></p><p><b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;represents the three aspects of consciousness ‚Äì waking, dreaming and sleeping, and it represents the three&nbsp;gunas ‚Äì satva, rajas&nbsp;and&nbsp;tamas. Holding a&nbsp;trishul&nbsp;(Trident) signifies that Shiva (the divinity) is above all the three states ‚Äì waking, dreaming and sleeping, yet is the upholder of these three states.<br>The divinity is beyond the three gunas, but it holds the three&nbsp;gunas&nbsp;together.</p><p><b>Shul</b>&nbsp;means problems or suffering.&nbsp;<b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;means that which destroys all kind of suffering.<br>Three types of pain that arise in life:<br>1.&nbsp;Aadibhautik&nbsp;(physical)<br>2.&nbsp;Aadhyaatmik&nbsp;(spiritual) and<br>3.&nbsp;Aadidaivik&nbsp;(ethereal)<br>What relieves you from all the problems and suffering is the&nbsp;trishul. And it is in the hand of Shiva.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-shiva-tattoo-4/">Lord Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

The term is also associated with the ‚ÄòFravashi‚Äô, the guardian angel and guide, which is actually the divine, uncorrupt and unpolluted part of the human soul. The Fravashi is the higher individuality that transcends to the Heaven when the human being‚Äôs life on earth is over.</p><p><strong>Farvahar Tattoo</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>winged disc symbol</strong>&nbsp;of Faravahar is influenced by the&nbsp;<strong>Egyptian winged sun</strong>&nbsp;that symbolizes divine kingship. All parts of it represent a basic Zoroastrian philosophy. The circle in the center symbolizes the immortality of a person‚Äôs soul and eternity of the universe. The human body coming out of it represents the mankind. Its upward-pointing hand indicates that the way to Heaven is through righteousness. While the ring in the other hand represents faithfulness and honoring of promises.</p><p>The two wings, one on either side, have 3 layers of feathers each that stand for the pillars of Zoroastrianism.&nbsp; Good words, good reflection/thought, and good deeds. The symbol‚Äôs lower part also has three parts representing bad words, bad thoughts and bad deeds that bring misfortune and misery to any individual. The two streamers/loops on the left and right signify the duality of good and evil, respectively.</p><p>Thus, Faravahar embodies the conflicting forces of good and bad and represents. The Zoroastrian philosophy of promoting one‚Äôs positive force and suppressing the negative. It is a reminder to the Zoroastrians of the purpose of their life and that is to live in a good way. That helps in the spiritual progression of the soul. So that it unites with the Supreme Lord of Zoroastrianism, Ahura Mazda.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/farvahar-tattoo/">Farvahar Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Now, we will have a look at some of the most common and well-known meanings of the Om symbol in the religion.</p><p>According to Hindu beliefs, ‚Äúthe essence of all beings on earth, the essence of earth is water, the essence of water are plants, the essence of plants are men, the essence of men is the speech, the essence of speech is the Rig Veda, the essence of the Rig Veda is the Sama Veda, and the essence of Sama Veda is Om.‚Äù</p><p>The older Upanishads also state that the Om symbol represents the struggle between the gods and demons. This is not actually meant to represent true gods and demons, but the inclinations of good and evil within humans. In other words, it is allegorical in nature.</p><p>Also, the Om symbol is implied to be that thing in humans which inspires good and altruistic actions and thoughts.</p><p>On a side note, within the Mandukya Upanishad, Om is mentioned as ‚Äúthe syllable of the whole world.‚Äù</p><p>In the first verse of this Upanishad, it states that time is made of three parts. The past, present, and future, or in other words A, U, and M.</p><p>Subsequent verses suggest that the Om is something like an ‚Äúacknowledgment. A melodic confirmation, and something that gives energy to a hymn‚Äù.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/om-tattoo/">Om Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A child, a brother, a charioteer, a warrior, a disciple, a guru, a cowherd, a messenger, the beloved of the gopis‚Ä¶ Throughout his life, Krishna enacted so many roles‚Äîthe whole time never forgetting. That they were just that, roles, and that his true nature was eternal, ever blissful consciousness. In this way, he was able to remain detached and thus perform flawlessly, never allowing the smile to fall from his face.</p><p><strong>‚ÄúThere have been very few who have been able to rejoice both in victory and in defeat,‚Äù</strong></p><p>Amma says. ‚ÄúSri Krishna is one who celebrated both life and death. That is why he was always able to give a big smile.</p><p>He took birth with a smile on his face, lived with a smile, and left his body with a smile. The message that he conveyed through his life is that we should make life full of laughter.‚Äù</p><p>Krishna‚Äôs life was so full, it would be impossible to recount it all here. It is told primarily through Srimad Bhagavatam, Garga Samhita, Visnu Purana, Brahmavaivarta Purana, Mahabharata, Harivamsa and several other Puranas. However, here are some of the broad strokes.</p><p>Krishna, in fact, took birth in a prison cell. A sage had told his egoistic uncle, King Kamsa, that he would be killed by his sister Devaki‚Äôs child. So Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and had each child she bore murdered. However, Devaki, and her husband, Vasudeva, finally were able to sneak one child off to safety. This was Sri Krishna. They sent Krishna off to Vraja, where he was raised by a foster mother, Yasoda. It was in Vrindavan, one of the villages of Vraja, that Krishna won the hearts of the gopis, the cowherds of the village. ‚ÄúBy spending all his time with the gopis of Vrindavan‚Äîplaying with them, joking with them, stealing their butter and milk, etc‚Äîwhat he actually was doing was stealing their hearts,‚Äù Amma says. It is from this that Krishna was given the name ‚ÄúChitta Chora‚Äù [one who steals the mind].</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-krishna-tattoo/">Lord Krishna Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="ctl01_mainContent_39661"><strong>The Five Eternal Elements</strong></p><p>When Bhagwan Swaminarayan set out on His spiritual journey at eleven years of age, He halted only after getting a reply to the question He had asked all across India. On His quest, He asked about the five eternal elements as revealed in the Vedas. He found a reasonable answer in Loj from Ramananad Swami‚Äôs chief disciple, Muktanand Swami. He accepted Ramanand Swami as His guru and then established the Swaminarayan Sampraday in Gujarat. Bhagwan Swaminarayan describes these five eternal elements and their relationship in great detail throughout the Vachanamrut.</p><p><strong>Pramukh Swami Tattoo Design,These five eternal elements are:¬†Jiva, Ishwar, Maya, Brahma, and Parabrahma.¬†</strong></p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl07_divpagercontrol"><strong>Jiva ‚Äì The Soul</strong></p><p>One‚Äôs true identity is not this human body, but the jiva that resides within it.&nbsp;The jiva, also called ‚Äòatma‚Äô or soul, is eternal ‚Äì it cannot be destroyed. The jiva has no gender; it is neither male nor female.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan discusses the nature of the jiva throughout the Vachanamrut.&nbsp;It is said to reside in our bodies in the same area as the heart.&nbsp;‚ÄúChildhood, youth, old age, stoutness, thinness, birth and death are all aspects of the body.</p><p>On the other hand, being uncuttable, being unpierceable, not aging, being immortal, being the embodiment of gnan [wisdom], being the embodiment of bliss, and being characterized by eternal existence are all aspects of the atma; they should in no way be considered as belonging to the body.‚Äù The jiva is free and pure, but we believe that we are restrained by maya. Once we understand that we are not this body and worship Purna Purushottam Narayan, we realize that our jiva is free from the clutches of maya and is worthy of moksha. The very essence of the Brahma-Parabrahma spiritual journey is to believe one‚Äôs self to be the atma and not this body, to become atmarup, and to worship Purna Purshottam Narayan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ishwar ‚Äì Divinities</strong></p><p>Ishwar transcends the jiva. It is the next element above the jiva.&nbsp;These beings partake in the creation, sustenance, and destruction of each universe.&nbsp;Ishwars are conscious spiritual beings that have greater realization than jivas.</p><p>While the jiva must work to realize its divine presence within the human body, ishwar is aware of that divinity. There are infinite ishwars, and but they are all bound by maya. Just as Purna Purshottam Narayan controls the jiva, He also controls the ishwars. Like the jivas, ishwars too aim to surpass maya and attain moksha.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl09_divpagercontrol"><strong>Maya ‚Äì Ignorance</strong></p><p>Maya is the ignorance that separates the jivas and ishwars from Brahma and Parabrahma. It is the desire that hinders a spiritual aspirant‚Äôs path to moksha. Maya directly translates to attachment for worldly objects. Maya is the instrument through which Parabrahma facilitates karma and moksha. Only when a devotee is able to overcome maya overcome the darkness of attachment to worldly objects is he or she able to attain moksha. Maya manifests from physical matter, and it is difficult for the jiva or ishwar to transcend. Bhagwan Swaminarayan has advocated the jiva to engage in constant bhakti or devotion to God. To move beyond maya and towards one‚Äôs liberation.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl10_divpagercontrol"><strong>Aksharbrahma ‚Äì The Eternal Abode</strong></p><p>The gunatit sadhu, Aksharbrahma, is the pathway to God and to moksha. It is only through Aksharbrahma that a jiva can associate itself with God and understand Him well enough to seek complete refuge in Him, thereby bringing the jiva out of the darkness of maya and into the light of Parabrahma. IParabrahma ‚Äì GodIn the Vachanamrut, Bhagwan Swaminarayan has described this Supreme God as all-knowing, all-powerful and yet compassionate. This Parabrahma governs all the other four elements of jiva, ishwar, maya and brahma. Swaminarayan devotees believe Bhagwan Swaminarayan to be Parabrahma.&nbsp;In the Vibhuti Yoga Adhyaya of the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, Shri Krishna speaks of that Supreme God living and working through him.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan in the Vachanamrut says that Purna Purushottam Narayan resides in Akshardham and visits this Earth to establish dharma for the sake of His devotees. He is always present in human form (pragat).&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/pramukh-swami-tattoo-design/">Pramukh Swami Tattoo Design</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mahamrityunjaya Mantra is one among the oldest and most important Mantra in Indian mythology and spirituality. This mantra belongs to Lord Shiva. It is a combination of three Hindi language words i.e. ‚ÄòMaha‚Äô, which means great, ‚ÄòMrityun‚Äô means death and ‚ÄòJaya‚Äô means victory, which turns into conqueror victory over death.It is also known as ‚ÄòRudra Mantra‚Äô or ‚ÄòTrayambakam Mantra‚Äô. The Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra is said to have been created by Rishi Markandeya. The Moon was once in trouble, cursed by King Daksha.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feathers are generally a very beautiful and gentle tattoo designs. Lots of girls and guys choose peacock feather simply because it is more beautiful than other feathers, while only a small number associates the feather to the meaning of peacock tattoos.</p><p>Feathers symbolize creativity, spiritual evaluation, and rebirth. Most common places for a peacock feather are ribs, scapulas or a side of the lower back. Peacock <a href="http://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/amazing-feather-tattoos-which-will-encourage-you-to-be-inked-immediately/">feather tattoos</a> should, by all means, be done in full color ‚Äì it is the colors that make it so beautiful.</p><p>Within the design of the peacock feather is what appears to be an eye, and that is part of the reason the peacock is also known as the bird of 100 eyes. The reference is directly related to the pattern of the eye that appears in its feathers, and these little birds are also thought to be all-seeing.</p><p>Peacock feathers, or mor pankh, are regarded as an auspicious symbol in Hindu mythology because of their association with the peacock, a beautiful bird which is also the national bird of India. You may have noticed that many people keep peacock feathers in their homes. It is believed that keeping peacock feathers at home brings good luck and prosperity into the house.</p><p>This design today is symbolic of a person who has an open mind, someone who sees the world with both their eyes open, or someone that is definitely not afraid of the challenges that lie ahead.</p><p>Peacock feather tattoo could indicate a very proud person. It could be comprehended in two ways. The person wearing it could either be very proud of herself for good reasons or simply very arrogant.</p><p><b>The&nbsp;Meaning&nbsp;of Ganesh</b></p><p><b>Gan<i>&nbsp;</i></b>means group. A universe is a group of atoms and different energies. This universe would be in chaos if there was no supreme law governing these diverse groups of entities.<br><b>The Lord of all these groups of atoms and energies is&nbsp;</b><strong>Ganesha</strong><b>.&nbsp;</b></p><p>He is the supreme consciousness that pervades all and brings order in this universe.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/peacock-feather-flute-ganesha-tattoo/">Peacock Feather with Flute Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two common symbols for zen enso. One is a brushstroke of a closed circle. The closed circle represents the totality of experience and life. The other is a brushstroke of a circle with one small opening. The open circle represents the imperfection found in all things and suggests to the student to stop striving for perfection and instead to allow the universe to be as it is.</p><p>The open circle is a concept that reflects closely with Japanese Zen Buddhism. The Japanese concept of wabi-sabi is that all things are perfect as they are. An analogy is a peasant&#8217;s jar, misshapen, chipped and worn through years of daily use. Although it may not be as pleasing visually as a pristine carefully crafted jar, it is said to stimulate the mind and emotions, stimulate the spirit of a person to contemplate the essence of reality. As with everything related to Zen, there is a beautiful simplicity to the traditional enso, both the open and closed versions.</p><p><strong>The classic symbol for Zen is the enso. It is known as the circle of enlightenment.</strong></p><p>In the sixth century, a text named the Shinhinmei refers to the way of Zen as a circle of vast space, lacking nothing, and nothing in excess. At first glance, the ancient enso zen symbol appears to be nothing more than a circle. But it&#8217;s symbolism refers to the beginning and end of all things, the circle of life, &amp; the connectedness of existence.</p><p>It is said that in the hands of a Zen master. The power of the enso symbol for zen is released. Helping those who meditate upon it to reach a higher level of consciousness. It is used as a symbol of enlightenment. Zen masters often brush paint an enso for their student to meditate upon. The quality of the brushwork is said to reveal the depth of the master&#8217;s enlightenment.</p><p><strong>Lotus flower tattoo designs</strong></p><p>are widely preferred by tattoo lovers all around the world. Popular amongst both, men &amp; women, lotus design is not only revered for its beauty, but also reflects a deeper spiritual meaning. The flower grows in muddy water, yet symbolizes purity and harmony. As a tattoo design too, lotus stands for the same attributes in human nature &amp; depicts the thoughts and attitude of the bearer.</p><p>Lotus flower is amongst the most amazing creations of nature and its beauty lies in its purity. The aesthetic brilliance of this wonderful flower has made it one of the most popular objects used in tattoo designs. Tattoo art has used natural objects such as&nbsp;dreamcatchers,&nbsp;feathers,&nbsp;anchors,&nbsp;flowers&nbsp;to make attractive depiction on human body. Lotus flower finds a great degree of usage in traditional as well as contemporary tattoo art. This attractive and eye catching lotus flower tattoo designs are a hot favorite among tattoo lovers. In the East as well as the West, and is featured in diverse sizes and colors &amp; on various parts of the body. Giving an elegant look to the tattoo bearer. The lotus flower not only looks beautiful when used in tattoo art, but also has a deeper meaning, as explained in various cultures &amp; religions across the world.</p><p><span id="Lotus_Flower_Tattoo_Placement_and_Designs"><strong>Lotus Flower Tattoo Placement and Designs</strong></span></p><p>It can be combined with certain images to convey the personal beliefs of the wearer &amp; can be much more than a style statement for him. Chinese tattoo art includes some inspirational characters along with the lotus, while Buddhists. May have the image of the Buddha added to it, in order to represent enlightenment. It is not only the design in lotus tattoos which is of great significance. But also the color chosen by the wearer matters a lot. As far as the appearance and symbolism of the tattoo is concerned. As said before, red, which is the color of passion, reflects deep devotion in the divine, when used in lotus tattoo design, while gold teamed with white lotus signifies the purity of the soul.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/zen-enso-tattoo/">Zen Enso Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sagittarius is the 9th sign that features in the zodiac wheel. It is also among the final 3 fire signs of the zodiac collection. It is mostly represented by an archer or the symbol of an archer. This archer will have a bow and an arrow and will be joined to a horse. Basically, it is a sign that shows half a person and half horse. The body of the human being is what will replace the head of the horse, but the other part is complete of a horse. The sign also represents people born between November the 23rd and December the 21st.</p><p>The Sagittarius Sign Tattoo or character can be applied on the body and they represent pride, passion, fury, courage, and independence.</p><p>The wearer of the tattoo will most likely have these personalities. They are also persons that can face any sort of challenge, without fear.</p><p>All of us are possessive about our identity and it means a lot to us. We express it in different ways and the sun sign tattoos are also a way of expressing our identity. People who belong to the Sagittarius sun sign are natural tattoo lovers as they are blessed with an artistic bent of mind. They love to explore and research and are also very fiery and straight-forward. The Sagittarius tattoos are best for conveying the fact that one was born under the ninth sign of the zodiac and is ruled by the fire element.</p><p>The tattoo has got a very sexy display and stands out from all other sun signs tattoos. The centaur and the archer represent the Sagittarians. The arrow is the symbol of the ardent and passionate sun sign. Men and women love both the designs. Those who want a simple and cute look generally go for the symbol while the ones wishing for an elaborate and catchy display choose the centaur and the archer.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/sagittarius-zodiac-tattoo/">Sagittarius Sign Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Shiva is often shown with many faces, as creator, destroyer and preserver in total command of the cosmos. He contains both good and evil. The main iconographical attributes of Shiva are the third eye on his forehead, the snake Vasuki around his neck, the crescent moon adorning, the holy river Ganga flowing from his matted hair, the Trishula as his weapon and the Damru as his musical instrument.He blesses his followers with grace, knowledge and peace.<span class="m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526Apple-converted-space m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/"><strong>Om with Trishul armband</strong></a></p><p><span class="m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg">As discuss above, that Shiva is the supreme Power in among all god.
