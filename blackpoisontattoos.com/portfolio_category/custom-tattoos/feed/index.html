										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoo art has always been a medium for self-expression, often reflecting an individual&#8217;s personality, beliefs, or experiences through permanent ink designs.</p><p>In the case of a particularly striking tattoo, a unique blend of whimsical humor and dark, intricate imagery creates a fascinating visual statement.</p><p>This tattoo showcases a skeletal figure wearing a jester&#8217;s hat, with two phrases encircling it: &#8220;Why so serious?&#8221; and &#8220;Hakuna Matata.&#8221;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fusion-of-contrasting-themes">The Fusion of Contrasting Themes</h3><p>The tattoo masterfully combines elements that are traditionally seen as opposites.</p><p>On one hand, the iconic phrase &#8220;Why so serious?&#8221; &#8211; popularized by the Joker in &#8220;The Dark Knight&#8221; &#8211; conjures a sense of deep, unsettling introspection about the darker sides of human nature.</p><p>On the other hand, &#8220;Hakuna Matata,&#8221; a Swahili phrase meaning &#8220;no worries,&#8221; brings in lightness and a carefree attitude, famously featured in the cheerful context of Disney&#8217;s &#8220;The Lion King.&#8221;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-artistic-details-and-symbolism">Artistic Details and Symbolism</h3><p>The detailed execution of the skull within the design is not just a representation of mortality or macabre but is stylized with exaggerated features typical of a jester.</p><p>This not only adds a layer of irony but also deepens the narrative by blending the seriousness of existential themes with the light-hearted dismissal of such worries.</p><p>The jester‚Äôs hat, embellished with bells, traditionally symbolizes folly and jest, yet here it is worn by a skull, perhaps hinting at the foolishness of ignoring the inevitability of death.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cultural-and-personal-significance">Cultural and Personal Significance</h3><p>This tattoo could be interpreted as a reflection of the wearer‚Äôs philosophy of life‚Äîbalancing the gravity of life&#8217;s inevitable challenges with a spirited, positive outlook.</p><p>It serves as a permanent reminder to not take life too seriously, thus resonating with a broad audience who find themselves oscillating between these two extremes.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>The tattoo not only stands as a piece of personal art but also engages with viewers by presenting a narrative that is open to interpretation.</p><p>Its ability to juxtapose profound depth with whimsical levity makes it a remarkable example of modern tattoo artistry.</p><p>This design not only catches the eye but also stimulates a deeper reflection on the balance of life&#8217;s dark and light moments.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/why-so-serious-hakuna-matata-tattoo/">üòØ Why so serious?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos are a deeply personal expression, and for many, they hold spiritual significance. One of the most awe-inspiring designs gaining popularity in the tattoo world is the fusion of <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong>, the <strong>Shivling</strong>, and <strong>Ram-Ram chants</strong>. This divine combination is not only visually powerful but also packed with spiritual symbolism, making it a meaningful choice for those looking to honor their faith and devotion.</p><p>In this blog, we‚Äôll explore the significance of this fusion tattoo, what each element represents, and why it‚Äôs an amazing design choice for anyone looking to blend faith and art.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-symbolism-behind-each-element">The Symbolism Behind Each Element</h3><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-lord-hanuman">1. <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong></h4><p>Lord Hanuman, one of the most revered deities in Hinduism, is the epitome of strength, devotion, and loyalty. Known as the mighty monkey god, he played a pivotal role in the <strong>Ramayana</strong>, serving as Lord Rama‚Äôs most loyal devotee. Hanuman is also seen as the protector, someone who guards against evil forces. His inclusion in a tattoo is often a mark of protection, courage, and immense dedication to a higher power.</p><p>For those who look to embody his fearless spirit, strength, and unwavering devotion, a Hanuman tattoo is a powerful symbol. Many designs capture him in his most iconic form‚Äîholding a mountain or ripping open his chest to reveal Lord Rama and Sita inside, showcasing his deep devotion.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-shivling">2. <strong>Shivling</strong></h4><p>The <strong>Shivling</strong> represents the infinite power and energy of <strong>Lord Shiva</strong>, the destroyer of evil and transformer of the universe. It signifies the balance of creation and destruction, serving as a reminder of life‚Äôs cyclical nature. For many, the Shivling is a powerful representation of their connection to the universe and their desire to remain in harmony with nature.</p><p>In tattoo designs, the Shivling is often depicted with vibrant shading and intricate detail, symbolizing Lord Shiva‚Äôs cosmic energy. It pairs beautifully with Lord Hanuman, as Hanuman is often considered an incarnation or devotee of Lord Shiva, thus blending their energies in one stunning design.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-ram-ram-chants">3. <strong>Ram-Ram Chants</strong></h4><p>The repeated chanting of <strong>‚ÄúRam-Ram‚Äù</strong> holds a unique place in the hearts of Hindu devotees. Lord Rama is the epitome of virtue and righteousness, and the continuous chanting of his name is believed to purify the soul and bring peace. Ram-Ram chants are often used in prayers and meditation as a form of devotion and mindfulness.</p><p>In tattoo art, these chants can be incorporated into the design in beautiful flowing scripts. The <strong>Devanagari script</strong>, in particular, is favored for its traditional look and adds a sense of spiritual depth to the tattoo. The repetitive mantra not only reinforces one‚Äôs devotion to Lord Rama but also serves as a constant reminder of inner peace and moral guidance.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-fusion-tattoo-is-powerful">Why This Fusion Tattoo is Powerful</h3><p>Combining <strong>Lord Hanuman, the Shivling, and Ram-Ram chants</strong> into a single tattoo creates a multi-dimensional piece of art that carries deep personal and spiritual meaning. Here&#8217;s why it&#8217;s such a compelling design:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Spiritual Significance</strong> ‚Äì Each element carries its weight of devotion, protection, and divine energy. Together, they create a strong visual and spiritual statement about the wearer‚Äôs faith.</li>

<li><strong>Personalized Design</strong> ‚Äì The fusion of these elements allows for a highly customized tattoo, as each aspect can be styled according to personal preferences‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs focusing more on Hanuman‚Äôs features or highlighting the flow of the chants around the Shivling.</li>

<li><strong>Symbol of Protection and Strength</strong> ‚Äì Hanuman‚Äôs presence symbolizes strength and loyalty, while the Shivling adds the element of cosmic energy and divine balance. The Ram-Ram chants tie the design together as a spiritual shield, protecting the wearer from negativity and evil forces.</li>

<li><strong>Cultural Reverence</strong> ‚Äì These symbols represent key deities and beliefs in Hinduism, making the tattoo a form of cultural homage. It connects the wearer to their roots and serves as a visual reminder of their spiritual journey.</li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-design-inspirations-and-ideas">Design Inspirations and Ideas</h3><p>If you‚Äôre considering getting this fusion tattoo, there are several creative ways to bring these elements together:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Backpiece Masterpiece</strong>: One popular approach is to make this tattoo a large backpiece, with Hanuman as the central figure, the Shivling below, and the Ram-Ram chants flowing around them. This style allows for detailed artistry and can convey a full narrative of devotion.</li>

<li><strong>Forearm or Sleeve Design</strong>: For those looking for a smaller or more compact version, a forearm tattoo can focus on Hanuman‚Äôs face, with the Shivling subtly incorporated and the Ram-Ram chants woven into the background. This design maintains clarity while using space efficiently.</li>

<li><strong>Minimalist Fusion</strong>: A minimalist approach could include a small Shivling with Hanuman‚Äôs face in silhouette form, with Ram-Ram chants delicately scripted around it. This design is ideal for those wanting a more subtle but deeply meaningful tattoo.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-key-considerations">Key Considerations</h3><p>When getting this tattoo, remember to:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Choose the Right Artist</strong>: Make sure your tattoo artist has experience with intricate designs and understands the spiritual significance behind these elements. You want the symbols to be respected and accurately depicted.</li>

<li><strong>Placement Matters</strong>: The placement of this tattoo can impact its visibility and size. Consider where you want to display this personal piece of art‚Äîwhether on a more private part of the body or prominently where others can admire it.</li>

<li><strong>Customization</strong>: Don‚Äôt be afraid to tweak the design to make it personal to you. Whether you want a more modern take on the Shivling or a detailed portrait of Hanuman, the design can be tailored to fit your vision.</li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3><p>A fusion tattoo of <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong>, the <strong>Shivling</strong>, and <strong>Ram-Ram chants</strong> is not just a body art choice; it‚Äôs a spiritual journey etched into your skin. This design is a beautiful homage to Hindu deities, encapsulating strength, protection, and devotion. Whether you&#8217;re deeply religious or simply admire the cultural significance, this tattoo can be a meaningful and visually stunning addition to your body art collection.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/the-ultimate-fusion-tattoo-lord-hanuman-shivling-and-ram-ram-chants/">The Ultimate Fusion Tattoo: Lord Hanuman, Shivling, and Ram-Ram Chants</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of Hindu symbolism offers a treasure trove of imagery for meaningful tattoos. Among these, the Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo stands out as a powerful representation of inner transformation and spiritual guidance. This blog post delves into the symbolism behind this unique design, exploring its historical significance and potential interpretations for the modern wearer.</p><p><strong>The Dance of Destruction and Renewal</strong></p><p>Shiva, the Hindu god of transformation, is often depicted in the ecstatic dance of Tandava. This cosmic dance represents the continual cycle of creation, destruction, and renewal within the universe. The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo frequently features Shiva in this dynamic pose, his body adorned with serpents and flames, symbolizing the transformative power he wields.</p><p><strong>The Guiding Presence of the Rishi</strong></p><p>Juxtaposed against Shiva&#8217;s energetic dance is the serene figure of a Rishi, a wise sage or seer. The Rishi acts as a counterpoint to Shiva&#8217;s dynamism, representing the wisdom and guidance needed to navigate the transformative process. In the tattoo, the Rishi is often depicted in a meditative posture, offering a sense of grounding and spiritual insight.</p><p><strong>Unveiling the Layers of Meaning</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo resonates with wearers on multiple levels. Here&#8217;s a deeper look at the symbolism it embodies:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Transformation and Rebirth:</strong> Shiva&#8217;s dance signifies the constant change inherent in life. By incorporating this image, the wearer acknowledges their own journey of growth and transformation.</li>

<li><strong>Inner Power and Destruction of Ego:</strong> The flames surrounding Shiva represent the burning away of illusion and ego. The tattoo serves as a reminder of the potential for immense inner power that lies within each of us.</li>

<li><strong>Seeking Guidance and Wisdom:</strong> The Rishi embodies the wisdom and knowledge needed to navigate life&#8217;s challenges. The tattoo signifies the wearer&#8217;s openness to guidance and spiritual growth.</li>

<li><strong>Balance and Duality:</strong> The contrasting figures of Shiva and the Rishi represent the inherent duality within the universe ‚Äì destruction and creation, chaos and order. The tattoo serves as a reminder of the importance of finding balance within oneself.</li></ul><p><strong>Beyond Symbolism: Personal Interpretations</strong></p><p>The beauty of the Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo lies in its ability to hold personal meaning for the wearer. Some interpretations include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>A Commitment to Spiritual Growth:</strong> The tattoo can symbolize a dedication to self-discovery and a willingness to embrace life&#8217;s transformative experiences.</li>

<li><strong>Overcoming Challenges:</strong> It can represent the courage to face inner demons and emerge stronger from difficult times.</li>

<li><strong>Honoring Lineage and Tradition:</strong> The Rishi can signify a connection to one&#8217;s spiritual lineage or a particular guru who has offered guidance.</li></ul><p><strong>Considering the Design</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo can be rendered in various artistic styles, from traditional Hindu art forms like Kolam or Madhubani to contemporary black and grey or vibrant illustrative styles. The choice of style ultimately depends on the wearer&#8217;s personal preferences and the desired level of detail.</p><p><strong>Placement and Size</strong></p><p>The size and placement of the tattoo can also hold significance. A larger, more elaborate design on the back or chest can represent a deep commitment to the symbolism, while a smaller, more discreet piece on the arm or ankle might offer a more personal reminder.</p><p><strong>Finding the Right Artist</strong></p><p>Given the intricate nature of the design, choosing a skilled tattoo artist with experience in Hindu iconography is crucial. Look for an artist who can capture the essence of the symbolism and translate it into a visually stunning and culturally respectful tattoo.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: A Powerful Talisman for Inner Transformation</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo is more than just a decorative piece of body art. It&#8217;s a powerful symbol that can serve as a constant reminder of the transformative potential within each of us. By understanding the rich symbolism behind this design, you can embark on a journey of self-discovery and embrace the power of inner transformation.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/shiva-rishi-tattoo/">Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Their portrayal in tattoos can encompass a wide spectrum, from the fierce and powerful to the enigmatic and mysterious.</p><p>When these two powerful symbols come together, they create a captivating fusion. The wolf&#8217;s untamed spirit juxtaposed with the woman&#8217;s enigmatic allure results in a tattoo that is both beautiful and thought-provoking.</p><p><strong>Delving Deeper: Meanings and Variations</strong></p><p>The specific meaning of a wolf and woman tattoo will depend on the individual&#8217;s interpretation and the design elements incorporated. Here are some common interpretations:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Strength and Femininity:</strong>&nbsp;This combination celebrates the duality within us all ‚Äì the powerful and the nurturing.</li>

<li><strong>Protection and Guidance:</strong>&nbsp;The wolf can symbolize a guardian spirit, while the woman represents the recipient of that protection.</li>

<li><strong>Connection to Nature:</strong>&nbsp;The wolf&#8217;s wild nature and the woman&#8217;s connection to the creative force represent a deep bond with the natural world.</li>

<li><strong>Wild Woman Archetype:</strong>&nbsp;The image can embody the untamed, instinctive side of femininity.</li></ul><p>The variations in design are endless. Some popular choices include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Realistic portrayals:</strong>&nbsp;Detailed renderings of wolves and women create a striking and powerful image.</li>

<li><strong>Watercolor style:</strong>&nbsp;Soft, flowing watercolors lend a dreamlike quality to the design.</li>

<li><strong>Geometric elements:</strong>&nbsp;Geometric shapes and patterns can add a modern twist to the traditional symbolism.</li>

<li><strong>Minimalist designs:</strong>&nbsp;Simple linework can create a beautiful and understated tattoo.</li></ul><p><strong>Finding the Perfect Design</strong></p><p>With so many possibilities, choosing the right wolf and woman tattoo design can be an exciting journey. Consider what resonates most with you. What aspects of the wolf and the woman do you want to represent? Do you have a specific image in mind, or would you prefer to collaborate with an artist to create a unique piece?</p><p>Remember, a tattoo is a permanent form of self-expression. Take your time, explore different design options, and find an artist whose style aligns with your vision.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/wolf-and-woman-fusion-tattoo/">Unveiling the Enigmatic Allure: Wolf and Woman Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

One such popular design is the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe. This design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also holds significant meaning for those who choose to ink it onto their skin. In this blog post, we will explore the history, symbolism, and variations of the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">History of Compass and Anchor Tattoo on the Globe</h2><p>The compass and anchor tattoo on the globe has a rich history that dates back to the maritime era. It was a common tattoo design among sailors, who would often get inked with it as a symbol of their travels and adventures. The compass represents direction, guidance, and exploration, while the anchor represents stability, strength, and grounding. Combining these two symbols with the globe creates a tattoo design that represents a sense of worldly adventure, a desire for exploration, and the need for grounding and stability.</p><p>As maritime culture spread, so did the popularity of the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe. It soon became a common design among non-sailors as well, and today it is one of the most popular tattoo designs across the globe.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Symbolism of Compass and Anchor Tattoo on the Globe</h2><p>The compass and anchor tattoo on the globe holds significant symbolism and meaning for those who choose to get inked with it. The compass represents a sense of direction and guidance, reminding the wearer to stay focused on their goals and aspirations. It also symbolizes a desire for adventure and exploration, encouraging the wearer to step out of their comfort zone and explore new horizons.</p><p>The anchor, on the other hand, represents stability and grounding. It serves as a reminder that no matter how far we may wander, we always have a place to call home. The anchor also represents strength, reminding us that we have the inner strength to weather any storm that comes our way.</p><p>When combined with the globe, the compass and anchor tattoo takes on a new level of meaning. It represents a sense of wanderlust and a desire to explore the world, while also acknowledging the importance of staying grounded and connected to our roots.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-variations-of-compass-and-anchor-tattoo-on-the-globe">Variations of Compass and Anchor Tattoo on the Globe</h2><p>While the basic design of the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe remains the same, there are many variations that allow individuals to personalize their tattoos to suit their individual styles and preferences. Some people opt for a minimalist design, featuring a small compass and an anchor on a simple outline of the globe. Others choose a more elaborate design, incorporating intricate details and shading to create a more realistic representation of the globe.</p><p>The placement of the tattoo can also vary, with some people choosing to ink it on their forearm or wrist for easy visibility, while others opt for a more private placement on their chest or back. The size of the tattoo can also vary, with some people choosing a small, subtle design, while others opt for a larger, more prominent tattoo.</p><p>While tattoos have been around for centuries, the popularity and acceptance of tattoos have grown significantly in recent years. Today, tattoos are not only a form of self-expression but also a way to showcase personal beliefs, experiences, and values. Whether you&#8217;re considering getting a compass and anchor tattoo on the globe or any other tattoo design, it&#8217;s essential to understand the symbolism and meaning behind it.</p><p>Ultimately, a tattoo is a personal choice, and the design you choose should reflect your individuality and values. Tattoos are a lifelong commitment, so it&#8217;s essential to carefully consider the design, placement, and meaning behind your tattoo before getting inked. Whether you choose a simple, minimalist design or an elaborate, intricate tattoo, your ink should be a reflection of who you are and what you stand for.</p><p>In conclusion, the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe is a popular design with significant meaning and symbolism.

Whether you&#8217;re a sailor or simply someone who loves to travel and explore the world, the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe is a beautiful way to showcase your love for adventure and groundedness.</p><p>If you&#8217;re interested in getting a compass and anchor tattoo on the globe, it&#8217;s essential to do your research and find a reputable tattoo artist. Look for an artist who specializes in the style of tattoo you&#8217;re interested in and has a portfolio of similar designs. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask questions, discuss your ideas with the artist, and make sure you feel comfortable before getting inked.</p><p>Once you have your tattoo, take proper care of it to ensure it heals properly and lasts a lifetime. Follow your artist&#8217;s aftercare instructions, avoid exposing the tattoo to direct sunlight or chlorine, and keep it moisturized with a gentle, fragrance-free lotion.</p><p>Getting a tattoo is a personal choice, and the meaning behind your tattoo can be as unique and individual as you are. The compass and anchor tattoo on the globe is a beautiful way to showcase your love for adventure, exploration, and groundedness, but it&#8217;s important to choose a design that resonates with you personally. Whether you choose a traditional design or a modern interpretation, your tattoo should be a reflection of who you are and what you stand for.</p><p>In summary, the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe is a popular and meaningful tattoo design with a rich history and symbolism. Whether you&#8217;re a sailor, traveller, or simply someone who loves adventure, this tattoo is a beautiful way to showcase your wanderlust and groundedness.

This design not only looks beautiful but also carries a deep and personal meaning for the wearer. In this article, we will explore the origins of the pocket watch tattoo, the symbolism behind it, and how to design the perfect pocket watch tattoo with a name and birth date.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Origins of Pocket Watch Tattoos</h2><p>Pocket watch tattoos have a long history dating back to the 17th century when pocket watches were first invented. Pocket watches were once a symbol of prestige and wealth, and were often passed down as family heirlooms. The intricate designs and mechanical workings of pocket watches made them fascinating to artists, who began to incorporate them into their art and designs.</p><p>Over time, pocket watch tattoos became a popular tattoo design, especially among those who wanted to honour a loved one or commemorate a special moment in time. The addition of a name and birth date to the tattoo further personalizes the design and gives it a deeper meaning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The symbolism of Pocket Watch Tattoos</h2><p>Pocket watch tattoos symbolize the importance of time and the fleeting nature of life. The ticking of a pocket watch serves as a constant reminder to cherish every moment and to make the most of the time we have. By adding a name and birth date, the tattoo becomes a tribute to a loved one who has passed away or a reminder of a special moment in the wearer&#8217;s life.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Designing the Perfect Pocket Watch Tattoo</h2><p>When designing a pocket watch tattoo with a name and birth date, there are many factors to consider. The size, placement, and style of the tattoo will all play a role in creating the perfect design.</p><p><strong>Size and Placement:</strong> Pocket watch tattoos can be as small or as large as you want them to be. Some people prefer a small, delicate design that can be easily hidden, while others opt for a larger, more intricate design that covers their entire shoulders. The placement of the tattoo on the shoulder is also important. Many people choose to place the tattoo on their dominant shoulder so that they can easily see it throughout the day.</p><p><strong>Style:</strong> Pocket watch tattoos can be designed in many different styles, from traditional to modern. Traditional pocket watch tattoos often feature a detailed design with intricate gears and clock hands, while modern designs may be more minimalist with simple lines and shapes. The font used for the name and birth date can also influence the overall style of the tattoo.</p><p>Colour: Pocket watch tattoos can be done in black and grey or in full colour. The choice of colour will depend on personal preference and the overall design of the tattoo.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, a pocket watch tattoo with a name and birth date is a timeless and meaningful design that carries a deep personal significance for the wearer. By incorporating the symbolism of time and the fleeting nature of life, this tattoo serves as a reminder to cherish every moment and to honour those we have loved and lost.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">The significance<b> of Crescent Moon on Lord Shiva‚Äôs Head</b></a></p><p>Shiva Tattva is where there is no mind and the moon signifies the mind. When there is no mind then how can this ‚Äòno-mindedness‚Äô be expressed and how can anybody understand it? You need a little bit of the mind to understand, experience and to express.</p><p>The no-mind, infinite consciousness requires that little bit of mind to express itself in the manifest world. So, to express that inexpressible, that little mind (crescent moon) is on the head.<br>Wisdom is beyond the mind, but it needs to be expressed with a tinge of mind and this is symbolized by the crescent moon.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Lord Shiva‚Äôs Damru</strong></b></p><p><b>Damru</b>&nbsp;symbolizes the Universe which is always expanding and collapsing. From an expansion it collapses and then it re-expands, this is the process of creation.<br>If you see your heartbeat, it is not just one straight line but it is a rhythm that goes up and down. The whole world is nothing but rhythms; energy rising and collapsing to rise again. So the&nbsp;damru&nbsp;signifies that. Look at the shape of the&nbsp;damru, from expansion it collapses and again expands.</p><p>Lord shiva tattoo &#8211; The darmru is also a symbol of sound. Sound is rhythm and sound is energy. The whole universe is nothing but a wave function, it is nothing but rhythms. What does quantum physics say? It says the same thing ‚Äì the whole universe is nothing but rhythms. It is just one wave (Adviata). So the damru signifies the non-dual nature of the universe.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Serpent around Lord Shiva‚Äôs Neck</strong></b></p><p>A state of samadhi where there is nothing, just the inner sky of consciousness, is Shiva; where there is alertness and no action. To describe this alertness they put a snake around Shiva‚Äôs neck.

Rose Tattoo</p><p>There are many myths and legends surrounding the creation of the rose. Its beauty, its fragrance, even the thorns have stories that explain the conception of this glorious flower. These rose tattoos are awesome embodiments of humans&#8217; constant attraction to a flower that has had everyone smitten since the dawn of time.</p><p>It was a symbol of love and beauty associated with the goddess, but also came to stand for secrecy after Cupid offered a rose to the God of Silence to keep quiet Venus‚Äôs affairs. In fact, Roman dining room ceilings were decorated with roses to urge guests to keep quiet about what was said at dinner, and ‚Äúsub rosa‚Äù or ‚Äúunder the rose‚Äù still means ‚Äúconfidentially‚Äù today.&#8221;</p><p>The traditional red rose tattoo symbolizes love and passion. A pink rose represents grace, gratitude, and affection while purple roses have been used to symbolize royalty and enchantment.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><p>Thus, for instance, in Greece this flower symbolized the blood of Aphrodite, in Rome it has been connected with the goddess Diana, who has transformed her lover into a rose, in Egypt it was a favorite flower of Isis, in Christian countries the rose has been associated with the blood of Christ. In the East, this flower was the sign of pure and sincere love.</p><p>In the current world, the denotation of the rose depends on its color and it doesn‚Äôt matter where the tattoo will be placed.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A black rose denotes tragic love, various subcultures invest their own meaning. Hence, for example, goths reckon that the black rose is death, for anarchists the same symbol is the fight.</li><li>A white rose shows pure love and a faithful essence of its owner.</li><li>A red rose indicates passion, desire, and love, whereas a burgundy rose spells out the idea of inner harmony.</li><li>A blue rose represents a sophisticated nature of a human, who wears it. He or she renounces all rules and foundations, adopted in the society, besides, this person strives for something unattainable.</li><li>A yellow rose has altered its meaning: at first, it meant jealousy, but now it connotes dedication.</li><li>An orange rose conveys that the owner is enthusiastic and attractive.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/rose-tattoo-3/">Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

I remember there is a sentence is ‚ÄúWhen the mind and hands are silenced the spirit is more focused‚Äù. There are many different meanings staying inside each tattoo. We have it to commemorate a member of the family, a relative, a friend or a person you admire who passed away. We have it to mark and raise ourselves up in hard periods in our life. Sometimes, we have it to just praying for the happiness and the health of our family. In general, the religious belief and comfort are what people aim in life.</p><p>God gave a gift to the world when you were born&#8230;Praying Hands In God&#8217;s hands lies a heart, a life that changed the world&nbsp;<strong>Praying hands symbolize obedience, submission, sincerity, repentance, veneration, and respect in regard to one&#8217;s higher power.</strong> The exact meaning of praying hands varies depending on which religious tradition is considered.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><strong>Praying hands tattoos Design Variations of the Tattoo</strong></a></p><p>The praying hands tattoo works well alone.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/"><strong>The koi fish is a symbol with extremely deep meaning for those who choose it as part of their body art. </strong></a></p><p>If you have been considering getting a tattoo that involves a koi fish, take the time first to learn the meaning associated with them. The traditional significance of a koi fish tattoo can vary depending on the fish‚Äôs orientation (whether it is going up or down your body) and color. You want to be sure that your koi fish tattoo conveys the desired meaning.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">Koi fish Tattoos</a> are prominent in the work of Japanese tattoo artists because of a long-standing legend of how the fish become dragons. Most of the meaning and symbolism behind the fish stems from this ancient legend. Beliefs about the meaning and direction a koi fish is swimming in vary greatly. Some theories of what it means are actually contradictory. But, if you are using a koi in your tattoo, you can choose the meaning that applies to you. Tattoos are your form of self-expression.</p><p>Koi fish are capable of adapting to many different climates and water conditions and can symbolize strength. It is inherent in a koi&#8217;s nature to swim upstream. Through the koi fish legend, you can see that they show great determination, dedication, perseverance, and success.</p><p>The black koi is associated with successfully overcoming an obstacle. This symbol is great for those who have gone through a tough battle in life and have finally made it to a place of strength. These obstacles can include depression, drug addiction, an abusive relationship, and many other situations.</p><p>Koi fish tattoos often incorporate various symbols, such as the yin-yang symbol, water, and fire, dragons, or lotus flowers.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/koi-fish-tattoo/">Koi Fish Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Throughout the book, It is generally refer to as male due to usually appearing as Pennywise. The Losers come to believe It may be female (because it lays eggs), and perceiving It&#8217;s true form as a monstrous giant spider. However, It&#8217;s true appearance is briefly observed by Bill Denbrough via the Ritual of Ch√ºd as a mass of swirling destructive orange lights known as &#8220;deadlights&#8221;, which inflict insanity or death on any living being that sees them directly. The only person to survive the ordeal is Bill&#8217;s wife Audra Phillips, although she is rendered temporarily catatonic by the experience.</p><p>Its natural enemy is the &#8220;Space Turtle&#8221; or &#8220;Maturin&#8221;, another ancient dweller of King&#8217;s &#8220;Macroverse&#8221; who, eons ago, created the known universe and possibly others by vomiting them out as the result of a stomachache.</p><p>The Turtle appears again in King&#8217;s series&nbsp;<i>The Dark Tower</i>.&nbsp;<i>Wizard and Glass</i>, one of the novels in the series.

Like the mysterious disappearance of the Derry Township&#8217;s 300 settlers in 1740-43 or the ironworks explosion.</p><p>It awoke during a great storm that flooded part of the city in 1957, with Bill&#8217;s younger brother Georgie. The first in a line of killings before the Losers Club fight the monster. A confrontation culminating in Bill using the Ritual of Ch√ºd to severely wound It and force It into hibernation. Continually surprised by the Losers&#8217; victory, It briefly questions its superiority before claiming that they were only lucky. As the Turtle is working through them. Pennywise makes a tangential appearance in King&#8217;s 2011 novel <i>11/22/63</i>, in which protagonist. Jake Epping meets a couple of the children from <i>It.</i> Asks them about a recent murder in their town, and learns that the murderer apparently &#8220;wasn&#8217;t the clown.&#8221;</p><p>It also appears to Jake in the old ironworks.

In a Sikh Jat family on 28 September 1907 in Lyallpur, Punjab in British India. His family had earlier involved in revolutionary activities against the British Raj.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">His uncle Swaran Singh had participated in the freedom struggle against the British.</a> When in 1907, another uncle of Bhagat. Ajit Singh was arrested and exiled to Rangoon in Burma (Myanmar), Swaran asked the people of Punjab to force the government for his release and due to his efforts, Ajit Singh was released from Rangoon jail in October 1907.</p><p>After coming back from jail, Ajit Singh decided to start a major revolt against the British. He began agitating the farmers and peasants to start a movement against them.</p><p>The British came to know of his intentions arrested him on 13 January 1911, when he was attending the Lohri festival celebration at his relative&#8217;s house. In February, Ajit Singh escaped from jail and ran away home, only to inform about his planning to start a mass struggle abroad in India.

At 2 pm as the boy Bhagat entered the bagh&#8217;s compound he saw blood scattered all over the ground. The turbans and torn clothes of people laid lifeless on the ground. The walls of the compound were red with blood. As it was a curfew in Punjab those days, the blood hadn&#8217;t been cleaned. Bhagat had taken a glass bottle with him before leaving from home. He took a handful of blood-stained soil and put it in the bottle. He reached home and put the bottle on in front of the Sikh gurus portrait and prayed to him for peace and solace for the victims of the massacre and he pledged to teach the British a lesson.</p><p>In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-cooperation movement to encourage a mass protest against the British and to boycott their trade in India, and to end their cooperation with British rule. Many people joined the movement and discarded the use of foreign goods and clothes. The people boycotted schools and colleges. The factories, industries, shops &amp; hospitals run by the government were all boycotted.

Remember that harming none includes harming yourself! &nbsp;This tattoo is the reminder that Good karma comes from truly good actions. It doesn‚Äôt work so well when you do good things, but for completely selfish reasons. And it absolutely does not work when you do things only for the purpose of getting a karmic reward.</p><p>Karma is in general formed by the combination of a person&#8217;s actions and intents. It depends not only on what the person actually does but also by the nature of their inner self.</p><p>The traditional, philosophical uses of karma have helped to connect the word. With a sense of &#8220;cosmic justice&#8221; in the Western vocabulary. In this sense, karma is often to refer to a mystic. The indefinable force that influences one&#8217;s immediate future. Western usage includes two distinct types of karma. There&#8217;s &#8220;good karma,&#8221; which one generates by doing good deeds and treating others well, and &#8220;bad karma,&#8221; which one creates by being inconsiderate and treating others poorly.</p><p><strong>Having a net amount of &#8220;good karma&#8221; will lead to good fortune in the future. While a net sum of &#8220;bad karma&#8221; will lead to hardship or bad luck.</strong></p><p>The belief in rebirth, or <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/"><span class="s1">samsara</span></a>, as a potentially endless series of worldly existences in which every being is caught up was already associated with the doctrine of karma in pre-Buddhist India, and it was accepted by virtually all Buddhist traditions. According to the doctrine, good conduct brings a pleasant and happy result and creates a tendency toward similar good acts. While bad conduct brings an evil result and creates a tendency toward similar evil acts.,</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/karma-tattoo-2/">Karma Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>History and Background</b></p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">Lord Krishna</a>, the eighth avatar of God Vishnu is worshiped as a supreme God in Hinduism. Born in northern India (around 3,228 BCE), Lord Krishna‚Äôs life marks the passing of the Dvapara age and beginning of the Kal yuga (which is also considered as the current age).Krishna Tattoo</p><p>References to Lord Krishna can be found in several Hindu mythological books, especially in the epic Hindu book, the Mahabharata.</p><p>Lord Krishna is also described as an important figure in the Bhagavata Purana. This is another Hindu epic book that dates to the 10th century B.C. In the text, Lord Krishna is described as the charioteer for the warrior Arjuna who had guided him morally and gave military counsel to the leader.</p><p>The divine birth</p><p>There came a time when Mother Earth was unable to bear the sins and cruelty committed by evil kings and rulers. Mother Earth then prayed to Lord Brahma, the creator of the Universe, to relieve her from these sinful kings. Lord Brahma prayed to the supreme Lord Vishnu for reincarnation and to relieve the Mother Earth from these evil rulers. Lord Vishnu accepted the request and assured to defeat tyrannical forces.</p><p>The ruler of Mathura, Kansa was one such evil king. He had a sister named Devaki, who was married to Vasudeva. The day Devaki and Vasudeva got married, a voice from the sky forecasted that Devaki&#8217;s eighth son will bring an end to Kansa‚Äôs rule and will kill him.Krishna Tattoo</p><p>Frightened Kansa held the couple. He then vowed that he will kill every child of Devaki and Vasudeva. Seeing their first seven children being killed by the cruel Kansa, the imprisoned couple feared giving birth to their eighth child.</p><p><strong>One night Lord Vishnu appeared before them.</strong></p><p>He told them that in the guise of their son, he will return and rescue them from Kansa&#8217;s autocracy.</p><p>The divine baby was born and the day he was born, Vasudeva found himself magically freed from prison. He ran away with the infant to a safer house and Lord Vishnu removed all the obstacles from Vasudeva&#8217;s path.</p><p>Vasudeva reached a house in Gokul, exchanged Lord Krishna with a new born girl of Yashoda and Nanda and returned to the prison with the girl child. As soon as Kansa came to know about the new-born, he again tried to kill the child. The infant ascends to the heavens and transformed into the goddess Yogamaya and said, &#8220;O foolish Kansa! What will you get by killing me? Your nemesis is already born.‚ÄùKrishna Tattoo</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">Krishna</a> was raised as a cowherd in Gokul and became a skilful musician. On his return to Mathura, he slayed Kansa and restored his father to power.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/krishna-tattoo-2/">Krishna Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">The significance<b> of Crescent Moon on Lord Shiva‚Äôs Head</b></a></p><p>Shiva Tattva is where there is no mind and the moon signifies the mind. When there is no mind then how can this ‚Äòno-mindedness‚Äô be expressed and how can anybody understand it? You need a little bit of the mind to understand, experience and to express.</p><p>The no-mind, infinite consciousness requires that little bit of mind to express itself in the manifest world. So, to express that inexpressible, that little mind (crescent moon) is on the head.<br>Wisdom is beyond the mind, but it needs to be expressed with a tinge of mind and this is symbolized by the crescent moon.</p><p><b>Significance of Lord Shiva‚Äôs Damru</b></p><p><b>Damru</b>&nbsp;symbolizes the Universe which is always expanding and collapsing. From an expansion it collapses and then it re-expands, this is the process of creation.<br>If you see your heartbeat, it is not just one straight line but it is a rhythm that goes up and down. The whole world is nothing but rhythms; energy rising and collapsing to rise again. So the&nbsp;damru&nbsp;signifies that. Look at the shape of the&nbsp;damru, from expansion it collapses and again expands.</p><p>Lord shiva tattoo &#8211; The darmru is also a symbol of sound. Sound is rhythm and sound is energy. The whole universe is nothing but a wave function, it is nothing but rhythms. What does quantum physics say? It says the same thing ‚Äì the whole universe is nothing but rhythms. It is just one wave (Adviata). So the damru signifies the non-dual nature of the universe.</p><p><b>Significance of Serpent around Lord Shiva‚Äôs Neck</b></p><p>A state of samadhi where there is nothing, just the inner sky of consciousness, is Shiva; where there is alertness and no action. To describe this alertness they put a snake around Shiva‚Äôs neck. So the&nbsp;<b>serpent</b>&nbsp;is a symbol of&nbsp;<b>alertness</b>.</p><p>In the state of meditation when the eyes are closed, it gives the impression that the person is sleeping, but he is not asleep, he is alert. To express this state of consciousness, a&nbsp;<b>snake</b>&nbsp;is shown around Lord Shiva‚Äôs neck.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><b>Significance of Lord Shiva‚Äôs Trishul (Trident)-Lord shiva tattoo</b></a></p><p><b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;represents the three aspects of consciousness ‚Äì waking, dreaming and sleeping, and it represents the three&nbsp;gunas ‚Äì satva, rajas&nbsp;and&nbsp;tamas. Holding a&nbsp;trishul&nbsp;(Trident) signifies that Shiva (the divinity) is above all the three states ‚Äì waking, dreaming and sleeping, yet is the upholder of these three states.<br>The divinity is beyond the three gunas, but it holds the three&nbsp;gunas&nbsp;together.</p><p><b>Shul</b>&nbsp;means problems or suffering.&nbsp;<b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;means that which destroys all kind of suffering.<br>Three types of pain that arise in life:<br>1.&nbsp;Aadibhautik&nbsp;(physical)<br>2.&nbsp;Aadhyaatmik&nbsp;(spiritual) and<br>3.&nbsp;Aadidaivik&nbsp;(ethereal)<br>What relieves you from all the problems and suffering is the&nbsp;trishul. And it is in the hand of Shiva.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-shiva-tattoo-4/">Lord Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
