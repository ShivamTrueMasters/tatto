										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This belief in reincarnation leads us to our next Hindu term &#8211; karma. Lucky for us, this one is bit more familiar. In very simplified terms, <b>karma</b> is the Hindu belief that a person&#8217;s actions in life will determine their fate in the next life. If a person is kind and selfless in this life, they&#8217;ll be rewarded in the next. Unfortunately, the opposite is also true. If a person is a scoundrel today, let&#8217;s just say they&#8217;ll be paying for it in their next tomorrow! Although our culture doesn&#8217;t always use the word karma. Vestiges of it are apparent in phrases like. &#8216;What goes around comes around,&#8217; or &#8216;He sure got what was coming to &#8217;em!&#8217;</p><p><strong>Sanskrit Tattoo</strong></p><p>To understand <b>moksha</b>, which means &#8216;liberation,&#8217; one must first understand several other important ideas in Hinduism &#8211; particularly, <b>samsara</b>. Samsara is a Sanskrit word. That refers to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, to the passing of the soul from one life to another. As the soul transitions between these lives, the next incarnation is informed by the deeds of the previous life. This is the Hindu belief of the concept of <b>karma</b>. You may have heard people talk about karma and the idea that people&#8217;s choices will come back to affect them one way or another in the future. The Hindu concept of karma is similar to the popular use, but a person&#8217;s responsibility for her/his actions. good or bad, is dealt with in the next life, not the current one.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/sanskrit-tattoo/">Karma and Moksha</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karma is the universal law that applies to each and every one of us. It means simply that everything you do will come back to you. Karma is a natural teaching tool, but knowledge, and the ability to apply that knowledge, is a great help.</p><p>This tattoo is the reminder that Good karma comes from truly good actions. It doesn‚Äôt work so well when you do good things, but for completely selfish reasons. And it absolutely does not work when you do things only for the purpose of getting a karmic reward. What you put out there is what you are going to get back. And if you do nothing but negative things in this lifetime, it will follow you to your next one.</p><p><strong>WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND</strong></p><p><strong>Karma Tattoo</strong></p><p>To understand&nbsp;<strong>moksha</strong>, which means &#8216;liberation,&#8217; one must first understand several other important ideas in Hinduism &#8211; particularly,&nbsp;<strong>samsara</strong>. Samsara is a Sanskrit word. That refers to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, to the passing of the soul from one life to another. As the soul transitions between these lives, the next incarnation is informed by the deeds of the previous life. This is the Hindu belief of the concept of&nbsp;<strong>karma</strong>. You may have heard people talk about karma and the idea that people&#8217;s choices will come back to affect them one way or another in the future. The Hindu concept of karma is similar to the popular use, but a person&#8217;s responsibility for her/his actions. good or bad, is dealt with in the next life, not the current one.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/karma-tattoo/">Karma Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alluring Lord Shiva Tattoo with Trishul &amp; Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra</p><p>Shiva (Sanskrit: Auspicious One) is one of the main deities of Hinduism that is worshipped as the paramount lord by the Shaivaite sects of India.</p><p>In Hinduism, Lord Shiva is regarded as the representation of the Supreme Being. He is known as the third element in the Hindu Trinity (Trimurti), the other two members being Lord Brahma &#8211; the creator, and Lord Vishnu &#8211; the protector. Shiva is the destructive form of the Almighty. As the cycle of destruction and recreation is always in a circle, Shiva‚Äôs primary responsibility is to maintain the life cycle. Scholars say, as the Mahakaal, Shiva destroys and dissolves everything into nothingness but as Shankara, he also reproduces that which has been destroyed and dissolved. His symbol of Lingam or the phallus represents this reproductive power.<br>Lord Shiva is also considered to be the most unique of all Hindu gods and also the God of all. A great ascetic, Shiva is the only godhead who is forever in deep meditation, totally absorbed in contemplation in His abode, Kailaasa Mountain in the great Himalaya. Lord Shiva is also said to be inseparable from Shakti &#8211; Parvati the daughter of Himavaan &#8211; Haimavati. There is no Shiva without Shakti and no Shakti without Shiva, the two are one &#8211; of the absolute state of being.</p><p>Shiva is often shown with many faces, as creator, destroyer, and preserver in total command of the cosmos. He contains both good and evil. He is moody, free of inhibitions, easy to please, protector of the downtrodden, and has the power to alter the laws of destiny. Thus, it is Lord Shiva who is known as the God of mercy and kindness. He protects his devotees from all evil that is always around us. He blesses his followers with grace, knowledge, and peace.</p><p>You may be interested in more <a href="/portfolio_category/lord-shiva-tattoos/">Shiva Tattoos</a>.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong>&nbsp;#LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-shiva-tattoo/">Alluring Lord Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
