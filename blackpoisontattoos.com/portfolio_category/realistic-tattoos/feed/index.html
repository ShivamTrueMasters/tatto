										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For centuries, warriors have adorned themselves with tattoos, symbols etched into the skin that served as badges of courage, testaments to victories, and reminders of their unwavering spirit. Among these powerful symbols, the Bare Essence Warrior Tattoo holds a unique allure.</p><p><strong>More Than Just Ink: The Bare Essence Mark</strong></p><p>The Bare Essence Mark, though its exact design varies, is said to represent the raw, untamed potential of the warrior within. It&#8217;s a symbol that transcends cultures and traditions, resonating with those who identify with the fight for what&#8217;s right.</p><p><strong>Choosing Your Bare Essence Mark Tattoo:</strong></p><p>There&#8217;s no single design for the Bare Essence Warrior Tattoo. Some choose bold, geometric patterns, while others opt for flowing, organic shapes. The key is to find a design that speaks to you, that captures the essence of your inner warrior.</p><p>Here are some things to consider when choosing your tattoo:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Symbolism:</strong>&nbsp;What imagery resonates with your warrior spirit? Animals like wolves or lions are popular choices, but explore options that hold personal meaning for you.</li>

<li><strong>Style:</strong>&nbsp;Do you prefer a bold, traditional style or a more delicate, illustrative approach? Research different tattoo artists to find one whose style aligns with your vision.</li>

<li><strong>Placement:</strong>&nbsp;Consider the visibility and practicality of the tattoo placement. Will it be a constant reminder or a more private symbol?</li></ul><p><strong>Beyond the Ink: Embodying the Warrior Spirit</strong></p><p>While the Bare Essence Warrior Tattoo is a powerful symbol, true strength lies not just in the ink, but in the spirit it represents. Here&#8217;s how to embody the warrior within:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Develop courage:</strong>&nbsp;Face your fears and stand up for what you believe in.</li>

<li><strong>Embrace challenges:</strong>&nbsp;See difficulties as opportunities for growth and self-improvement.</li>

<li><strong>Cultivate discipline:</strong>&nbsp;Train your body and mind to overcome obstacles.</li>

<li><strong>Find your purpose:</strong>&nbsp;A strong purpose fuels your inner warrior and gives direction to your strength.</li></ul><p><strong>The Bare Essence Warrior Tattoo: A Permanent Mark of Strength</strong></p><p>The Bare Essence Warrior Tattoo is more than just body art; it&#8217;s a permanent reminder of the warrior spirit that resides within you. It&#8217;s a commitment to facing challenges, embodying courage, and striving to be your best self.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/mystic-glyphs-tarot-tales-in-ink/">Ink of the Brave: Unveiling the Bare Essence Warrior Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of tattoos is brimming with symbolism and personal expression. Among the most captivating designs are those featuring wolves and women, a combination that exudes an air of haunting harmony.</p><p>The wolf, a powerful predator revered for its intelligence and loyalty, has long been a source of fascination in mythology and folklore. Often depicted as a guardian or spirit guide, the wolf embodies strength, independence, and a deep connection to the wild.</p><p>Women, on the other hand, represent the very essence of creation, nurturing, and intuition. Their portrayal in tattoos can encompass a wide spectrum, from the fierce and powerful to the enigmatic and mysterious.</p><p>When these two powerful symbols come together, they create a captivating fusion. The wolf&#8217;s untamed spirit juxtaposed with the woman&#8217;s enigmatic allure results in a tattoo that is both beautiful and thought-provoking.</p><p><strong>Delving Deeper: Meanings and Variations</strong></p><p>The specific meaning of a wolf and woman tattoo will depend on the individual&#8217;s interpretation and the design elements incorporated. Here are some common interpretations:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Strength and Femininity:</strong>&nbsp;This combination celebrates the duality within us all – the powerful and the nurturing.</li>

<li><strong>Protection and Guidance:</strong>&nbsp;The wolf can symbolize a guardian spirit, while the woman represents the recipient of that protection.</li>

<li><strong>Connection to Nature:</strong>&nbsp;The wolf&#8217;s wild nature and the woman&#8217;s connection to the creative force represent a deep bond with the natural world.</li>

<li><strong>Wild Woman Archetype:</strong>&nbsp;The image can embody the untamed, instinctive side of femininity.</li></ul><p>The variations in design are endless. Some popular choices include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Realistic portrayals:</strong>&nbsp;Detailed renderings of wolves and women create a striking and powerful image.</li>

<li><strong>Watercolor style:</strong>&nbsp;Soft, flowing watercolors lend a dreamlike quality to the design.</li>

<li><strong>Geometric elements:</strong>&nbsp;Geometric shapes and patterns can add a modern twist to the traditional symbolism.</li>

<li><strong>Minimalist designs:</strong>&nbsp;Simple linework can create a beautiful and understated tattoo.</li></ul><p><strong>Finding the Perfect Design</strong></p><p>With so many possibilities, choosing the right wolf and woman tattoo design can be an exciting journey. Consider what resonates most with you. What aspects of the wolf and the woman do you want to represent? Do you have a specific image in mind, or would you prefer to collaborate with an artist to create a unique piece?</p><p>Remember, a tattoo is a permanent form of self-expression. Take your time, explore different design options, and find an artist whose style aligns with your vision.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/wolf-and-woman-fusion-tattoo/">Unveiling the Enigmatic Allure: Wolf and Woman Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk about portrait tattoos, but what exactly do they mean? What makes them so appealing? And, most importantly, is it possible to get a portrait tattoo without getting sunburnt afterward? In this article, we&#8217;ll answer all these questions and more.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beautiful-portrait-tattoo"><strong>Beautiful Portrait Tattoo</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>A portrait tattoo of a loved one&nbsp;is often one of the most popular and sought-after tattoos. These types of tattoos are usually done in black-and-white or just black. The reason for this is that it gives the tattoo a classic look that is easy to match with any style you have going on.</p><p>The most common way to get a portrait tattoo is by having it done on your arm, leg, or back. This makes it easier for you to hide the tattoo when you want to, but it also makes it very visible if you want others to see it too!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-a-portrait-tattoo-mean"><strong>What does a portrait tattoo mean?</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>A portrait tattoo is a great way to honor someone or commemorate an important time in your life. For example, you might get a portrait of your best friend to show them how much they mean to you. Or perhaps you want something special that represents your love for your partner—a portrait of theirs will be perfect! If a birthday or anniversary comes along, why not commemorate it with a unique tattoo design?</p><p>A portrait can also be used to celebrate achievements or milestones in life: if someone has graduated from college, this would be the perfect opportunity for them to add something special to their body.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-portrait-tattoos-painful"><strong>Are portrait tattoos painful?</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>Tattoos are a long process that involves the artist doing several passes with the tattoo machine before completing a design. This can cause some discomfort for you, but there are ways to minimize this pain and make your experience more comfortable.</p><p>First of all, make sure you go to a reputable tattoo shop where that uses sterile needles and ink. Also, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask about numbing creams or certain techniques that will help reduce your discomfort during the process—such as adding breaks in between sessions or using an electric handpiece instead of disposable ones (which can cause additional irritation).</p><p>Tattoos are permanent marks on your skin and they take years (or even decades) before they fade away completely! So it&#8217;s important that you&#8217;re absolutely sure about what designs you want before getting them permanently etched onto yourself!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-hours-does-a-portrait-tattoo-take"><strong>How many hours does a portrait tattoo take?</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>How long does it take to get a portrait tattoo?</p><p>Well, that&#8217;s a great question! And there are a lot of answers mixed into that one question. It depends on how big the tattoo is and where you want it placed on your body. It also depends on how experienced your tattoo artist is and what kind of equipment they use to create your design. Another important factor is how well you take care of your skin after getting the tattoo applied—but more about that later!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-is-the-best-place-to-put-a-portrait-tattoo"><strong>Where is the best place to put a portrait tattoo?</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>The best place to get a portrait tattoo is on your upper chest, just below your neck, and above your breasts. This is because it&#8217;s very visible and can be seen by other people easily. It&#8217;s also quite personal since it&#8217;s close to your heart! You will have constant reminders of who you love with every breath you take, which is why I recommend getting this type of tattoo at night or in the morning before starting your day.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-i-choose-a-portrait-tattoo"><strong>How do I choose a portrait tattoo?</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>Choosing a portrait is an important decision, so you&#8217;ll want to ensure that the tattoo you&#8217;ve chosen has meaning. You should also look at tattoos of faces in general and see if there are any other styles that appeal to you.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Make sure your tattoo is realistic, not cartoonish. For example, if your tattoo is an actual photograph of a person&#8217;s face and it looks like something out of &#8220;The Simpsons,&#8221; then maybe reconsider getting the same kind of drawing on your body.</li>

<li>Choose one that&#8217;s well-drawn and well-inked. Just because someone has been doing portraits since they were 10 years old doesn&#8217;t mean they have skills as an artist or know how to draw every feature with accuracy&#8211;or even at all! So before going under the needle (if possible), ask them about their process and whether or not they&#8217;ve ever had any formal training in art or anatomy; if not, find someone else who can do both of those things justice!</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>If you’re looking for a unique tattoo idea, a portrait tattoo could be a perfect choice. Whether it’s someone in your family or even yourself (or your other half), there are so many options out there! Just make sure that you do your research before getting inked up – after all, tattoos are permanent!</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/mothers-portrait-tattoo/">Mother’s Portrait Tattoo &#8211; In memory of loved ones</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>These are the best bee tattoos that you can get!</strong></p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-honey-bumble-queen-africanized-carpenter-leopard-print-cute-little-small-baby-cartoon-bee-tattoo-guide">Your Honey, Bumble, Queen, Africanized, Carpenter, Leopard Print, Cute little small baby cartoon bee tattoo guide.</h4><p>If you’re looking for a cute small baby cartoon bee tattoo design, this guide is for you!</p><p>In this article, we are going to cover all kinds of bees. You’ll get an Africanized bee tattoo and Bumble Bee Tattoo. As well as:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Honey Bee Tattoo</li><li>Queen Bee Tattoo</li><li>Carpenter Bee Tattoo</li><li>Leopard Print Bee Tattoo</li><li>Cute Small Baby Cartoon Bee Design</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-honey-bee-tattoo">Honey Bee Tattoo</h4><p>If you&#8217;re looking to get a sweet honey bee tattoo, check out the following meanings and designs.</p><p>Honey Bee Tattoo Meaning:</p><p>Honey bees are associated with many positive things like beauty, fertility, and abundance. They may symbolize love or even motherhood.</p><p>Honey Bee Tattoo Designs:</p><p>These can be found in various shapes such as butterflies, birds, and flowers as well as words like “hope” or “sweetheart”! The most popular choice seems to be flower arrangements with yellow and white petals representing honeycomb cells containing pollen from flowers that bees pollinate during springtime when flowers are blooming in abundance across North America (and elsewhere).</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bumble-bee-tattoo">Bumble Bee Tattoo</h4><p>Bumble bee tattoos are quite popular among women because they represent a sense of freedom, beauty, and power. These tiny insects are not aggressive by nature, and as a result, their tattoo designs tend to be cute and soft. The symbol of bees is also associated with creativity and fertility, so many people choose this design to enhance the feminine energy in their lives.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bumble-bee-tattoo-designs">Bumble Bee Tattoo Designs</h4><p>There are many different ways you can design your bumble bee tattoo. Here are some examples:</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-queen-bee-tattoo">Queen Bee Tattoo</h4><p>If you’re looking for a bee tattoo, you may be wondering what type of bee to get. There are many different kinds of bees out there, each with its own set of characteristics and jobs to do. A queen bee tattoo is one of the most popular designs because it’s simple and easy to recognize &#8211; the queen is usually depicted as being larger than other honeybees in her hive, and she has two sets of wings!</p><p>While many tattoos feature images of just any old bee or even an entire colony, queen bee tattoos are designed to look like a specific kind: specifically, they show an actual queen honeybee in flight. Because this species is so large compared with other insects (including worker bees), it stands out from the crowd when depicted on skin.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-africanized-bee-tattoo">Africanized Bee Tattoo</h4><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Africanized bees are significantly more aggressive than European honey bees. They will attack people who get too close to their hives, and they&#8217;re also more likely to sting someone who accidentally disturbs them.</li><li>Africanized bees are more likely to swarm than European honey bees. Swarming is when a colony of bees leaves its hive in search of a new location, sometimes in huge numbers (hundreds of thousands).</li><li>Africanized bees are more likely to chase someone away from the area around their hive, whereas European honey bee colonies tend not to do this in general (though they may chase if they feel threatened).</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-carpenter-bee-tattoo">Carpenter Bee Tattoo</h4><p>A large, black insect could be a carpenter bee. Carpenter bees are black and yellow and can be as big as a bumblebee. They have large, hairy eyes and an abdomen that’s mostly black, but with bright yellow markings on their thoraxes (the middle section of their bodies). Females have longer abdomens than males do.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leopard-print-bee-tattoo">Leopard Print Bee Tattoo</h4><p>If you are looking for the best example of a leopard print bee tattoo then look no further. The design is unique, bold, and beautiful. It&#8217;s a perfect example of how to make your own statement with this type of tattoo. The artist has created a stunning piece that has been done so well that it almost looks as if it&#8217;s made from flowers instead of ink.</p><p>This particular design is based on the Africanized honey bee which originated in Brazil but was later introduced into other countries around the world such as North America where they now thrive today due to their ability to survive environments that would normally be unsuitable for them because of climate change such as deserts where temperatures can reach up over 40°C during summer months (or “hot spells” as Americans call them).</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cute-bee-tattoo">Cute Bee Tattoo</h4><p>When you think of a tattoo, you might be imagining a large piece of art that takes up your entire back. However, there are many smaller tattoos &#8211; meaning those that fit on a small part of the body &#8211; that can be just as impactful.</p><p>Here are some tips for choosing and placing a small bee tattoo:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Think about the area of your body where you want to place this tattoo. You&#8217;ll want to consider whether or not it will be visible through clothing and if it will look good when layered with other tattoos.</li><li>Select an artist based on their portfolio and reputation for creating small tattoos like bees. You should also ask them about their experience working in this particular style in case there are any special considerations related to placement or design elements within the bee itself (e.g., wings).</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-small-bee-tattoo">Small Bee Tattoo</h4><p>If you’re thinking about getting a small bee tattoo, it’s probably because they’re cute and you love the meaning behind them. But what if you have no idea what the design of your small bee tattoo should look like?</p><p>If so, we have some ideas for where to start. Without further ado, consult our artists and they will guide you with your small bee tattoo.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-baby-bee-tattoo-designs">Baby Bee Tattoo Designs</h4><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Baby bee tattoo designs are very cute, adorable, and small. They are so popular among women that they can be placed anywhere on the body. The same is true for men who love to wear them in many different places on their bodies.</li><li>They&#8217;re also very popular among couples and friends because they show your affection for each other by getting a matching tattoo together.</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cartoon-bee-tattoo-ideas">Cartoon Bee Tattoo Ideas</h4><p>A cartoon bee is a symbol of hard work and determination. The bee represents our many efforts to be productive and successful in life. Bees are also known as the “working ants” because they are very busy and always working hard. Bees display a high level of resilience, which makes them an ideal icon for people who need the inspiration to achieve their goals.</p><p>Bees have been associated with wisdom since ancient times, so if you want to get this tattoo design to express your wise character, then we recommend choosing a perfect location on your body where it will look attractive when it shows off the meaning behind this image – your forearm or ankle!</p><p>A tattoo with a cartoon bee can be designed in many different ways: from simple black ink designs that resemble bees on flowers or honeycombs up to more detailed pieces filled with intricate floral elements combined with bright colors that make these tattoos fun-looking designs suitable for anyone who wants something visually pleasing without being too flashy (although some artists may choose different colors).</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>This honeybee tattoo guide will help you find the right design for your body. We&#8217;ve covered a lot of ground in this article, but there are still plenty more options out there that we didn&#8217;t have space to cover (maybe next spring?). So if you&#8217;re looking for an idea on how to pay homage to the hardworking busy bees around us, these designs should give you some inspiration. Or if you&#8217;re just looking for something cute and simple like the emoji? Then look no further than our list of options!</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/cute-colorful-bee-tattoo/">Cute Colorful Bee Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">The significance<b> of Crescent Moon on Lord Shiva’s Head</b></a></p><p>Shiva Tattva is where there is no mind and the moon signifies the mind. When there is no mind then how can this ‘no-mindedness’ be expressed and how can anybody understand it? You need a little bit of the mind to understand, experience and to express.</p><p>The no-mind, infinite consciousness requires that little bit of mind to express itself in the manifest world. So, to express that inexpressible, that little mind (crescent moon) is on the head.<br>Wisdom is beyond the mind, but it needs to be expressed with a tinge of mind and this is symbolized by the crescent moon.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Damru</strong></b></p><p><b>Damru</b>&nbsp;symbolizes the Universe which is always expanding and collapsing. From an expansion it collapses and then it re-expands, this is the process of creation.<br>If you see your heartbeat, it is not just one straight line but it is a rhythm that goes up and down. The whole world is nothing but rhythms; energy rising and collapsing to rise again. So the&nbsp;damru&nbsp;signifies that. Look at the shape of the&nbsp;damru, from expansion it collapses and again expands.</p><p>Lord shiva tattoo &#8211; The darmru is also a symbol of sound. Sound is rhythm and sound is energy. The whole universe is nothing but a wave function, it is nothing but rhythms. What does quantum physics say? It says the same thing – the whole universe is nothing but rhythms. It is just one wave (Adviata). So the damru signifies the non-dual nature of the universe.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Serpent around Lord Shiva’s Neck</strong></b></p><p>A state of samadhi where there is nothing, just the inner sky of consciousness, is Shiva; where there is alertness and no action. To describe this alertness they put a snake around Shiva’s neck. So the&nbsp;<b>serpent</b>&nbsp;is a symbol of&nbsp;<b>alertness</b>.</p><p>In the state of meditation when the eyes are closed, it gives the impression that the person is sleeping, but he is not asleep, he is alert. To express this state of consciousness, a&nbsp;<b>snake</b>&nbsp;is shown around Lord Shiva’s neck.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Trishul (Trident)-Lord shiva tattoo</strong></b></p><p><b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;represents the three aspects of consciousness – waking, dreaming and sleeping, and it represents the three&nbsp;gunas – satva, rajas&nbsp;and&nbsp;tamas. Holding a&nbsp;trishul&nbsp;(Trident) signifies that Shiva (the divinity) is above all the three states – waking, dreaming and sleeping, yet is the upholder of these three states.<br>The divinity is beyond the three gunas, but it holds the three&nbsp;gunas&nbsp;together.</p><p><b>Shul</b>&nbsp;means problems or suffering.&nbsp;<b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;means that which destroys all kind of suffering.<br>Three types of pain that arise in life:<br>1.&nbsp;Aadibhautik&nbsp;(physical)<br>2.&nbsp;Aadhyaatmik&nbsp;(spiritual) and<br>3.&nbsp;Aadidaivik&nbsp;(ethereal)<br>What relieves you from all the problems and suffering is the&nbsp;trishul. And it is in the hand of Shiva.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/shiva-shakti-tattoo/">Shiva Shakti Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Rose Tattoo</p><p>There are many myths and legends surrounding the creation of the rose. Its beauty, its fragrance, even the thorns have stories that explain the conception of this glorious flower. These rose tattoos are awesome embodiments of humans&#8217; constant attraction to a flower that has had everyone smitten since the dawn of time.</p><p>It was a symbol of love and beauty associated with the goddess, but also came to stand for secrecy after Cupid offered a rose to the God of Silence to keep quiet Venus’s affairs. In fact, Roman dining room ceilings were decorated with roses to urge guests to keep quiet about what was said at dinner, and “sub rosa” or “under the rose” still means “confidentially” today.&#8221;</p><p>The traditional red rose tattoo symbolizes love and passion. A pink rose represents grace, gratitude, and affection while purple roses have been used to symbolize royalty and enchantment.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><p>Thus, for instance, in Greece this flower symbolized the blood of Aphrodite, in Rome it has been connected with the goddess Diana, who has transformed her lover into a rose, in Egypt it was a favorite flower of Isis, in Christian countries the rose has been associated with the blood of Christ. In the East, this flower was the sign of pure and sincere love.</p><p>In the current world, the denotation of the rose depends on its color and it doesn’t matter where the tattoo will be placed.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A black rose denotes tragic love, various subcultures invest their own meaning. Hence, for example, goths reckon that the black rose is death, for anarchists the same symbol is the fight.</li><li>A white rose shows pure love and a faithful essence of its owner.</li><li>A red rose indicates passion, desire, and love, whereas a burgundy rose spells out the idea of inner harmony.</li><li>A blue rose represents a sophisticated nature of a human, who wears it. He or she renounces all rules and foundations, adopted in the society, besides, this person strives for something unattainable.</li><li>A yellow rose has altered its meaning: at first, it meant jealousy, but now it connotes dedication.</li><li>An orange rose conveys that the owner is enthusiastic and attractive.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/rose-tattoo-3/">Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

They are mainly worn by men, but some women may like them as well.</strong></a></p><p>Scorpions are among the most dangerous creatures on Earth. They&#8217;re also beautiful, so why not add a little bit of danger to your body art? Scorpion tattoos are popular for both men and women.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-black-scorpion">The Black Scorpion</h4><p>The black scorpion tattoo design has been used by people for centuries. It&#8217;s one of the oldest symbols known to man. This symbol represents strength, power, and protection.</p><p>A scorpion tattoo represents the traits and attributes of the scorpion. Someone who gets this arachnid tatted on their body might want to send the message that they are deadly, stealthy, and not to be messed with. In addition to representing the scorpion&#8217;s characteristics, this tat could also be a symbol of a variety of other meanings, such as the zodiac sign Scorpio.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">scorpion and rose tattoo</a> represents two living things that are not to be judged by their covers. The scorpion is small, yet intimidating, and the rose is beautiful but can hurt someone with its thorns. Both the scorpion and the rose should be admired from a distance. Getting a tattoo with a scorpion and rose means that you are someone. Who cannot be judged and that people should be wary when trying to get close to you. Either physically or spiritually. A scorpion with a rose tail could mean that you are a double-edged sword. You can sting, but you can also be pleasant.</p><p>Scorpion and rose tattoos convey to others that living things should not be judged by their appearances. Even though both are very beautiful, both the scorpion and the rose can bring about great pain and should be admired from afar. Those with scorpions and roses tattooed on their body send a message to others that it may be difficult to get emotionally or physically too close to them.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/scorpio-tattoo/">Best Scorpion Tattoo Design of All Time</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

The traditional significance of a koi fish tattoo can vary depending on the fish’s orientation (whether it is going up or down your body) and color. You want to be sure that your koi fish tattoo conveys the desired meaning.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">Koi fish Tattoos</a> are prominent in the work of Japanese tattoo artists because of a long-standing legend of how the fish become dragons. Most of the meaning and symbolism behind the fish stems from this ancient legend. Beliefs about the meaning and direction a koi fish is swimming in vary greatly. Some theories of what it means are actually contradictory. But, if you are using a koi in your tattoo, you can choose the meaning that applies to you. Tattoos are your form of self-expression.</p><p>Koi fish are capable of adapting to many different climates and water conditions and can symbolize strength. It is inherent in a koi&#8217;s nature to swim upstream. Through the koi fish legend, you can see that they show great determination, dedication, perseverance, and success.</p><p>The black koi is associated with successfully overcoming an obstacle. This symbol is great for those who have gone through a tough battle in life and have finally made it to a place of strength. These obstacles can include depression, drug addiction, an abusive relationship, and many other situations.</p><p>Koi fish tattoos often incorporate various symbols, such as the yin-yang symbol, water, and fire, dragons, or lotus flowers.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/koi-fish-tattoo/">Koi Fish Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

The Losers come to believe It may be female (because it lays eggs), and perceiving It&#8217;s true form as a monstrous giant spider. However, It&#8217;s true appearance is briefly observed by Bill Denbrough via the Ritual of Chüd as a mass of swirling destructive orange lights known as &#8220;deadlights&#8221;, which inflict insanity or death on any living being that sees them directly. The only person to survive the ordeal is Bill&#8217;s wife Audra Phillips, although she is rendered temporarily catatonic by the experience.</p><p>Its natural enemy is the &#8220;Space Turtle&#8221; or &#8220;Maturin&#8221;, another ancient dweller of King&#8217;s &#8220;Macroverse&#8221; who, eons ago, created the known universe and possibly others by vomiting them out as the result of a stomachache.</p><p>The Turtle appears again in King&#8217;s series&nbsp;<i>The Dark Tower</i>.&nbsp;<i>Wizard and Glass</i>, one of the novels in the series.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wolf Tattoo &#8211; Out of all the birds in <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">mythology and symbolism</a>, there is no greater or more recognized than the crow or raven. This large, blackbird has long been one of the smartest animals on earth, a lover of shiny objects, and perhaps even an intuitive trickster.</p><p>Wolf tattoos are very popular and consider to be the mainstream tattoos. They can be design in a variety of different ways and portrayed with different elements and symbols. Just like all animal tattoos, the wolf tattoo represents the traits and attributes of the wolf. The wolf is a very symbolic creature that holds deep meaning for many different cultures. Throughout history, most notably with Native Americans. To numerous tribes across North America and in other parts of the world, wolves are very powerful and important.</p><p>The eye of Providence design is also by the secret society of the Free Masons, DARPA. And on the official seal of Colorado.</p><p>The all-seeing eye’s usage by government entities, the Federal Reserve, and secret societies. Which led some to believe that the symbol also holds a darker connotation.</p><p>Those who follow this line of thought believe that the all-seeing eye is used as a subconscious marker or a way to denote covert control of the world by a group of ultra-elite oligarchs, leaders of industry and politicians, known as the “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><span class="s1">illuminati</span></a>”, or “enlightened ones”.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/wolf-tattoo/">Wolf Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

His family had earlier involved in revolutionary activities against the British Raj.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">His uncle Swaran Singh had participated in the freedom struggle against the British.</a> When in 1907, another uncle of Bhagat. Ajit Singh was arrested and exiled to Rangoon in Burma (Myanmar), Swaran asked the people of Punjab to force the government for his release and due to his efforts, Ajit Singh was released from Rangoon jail in October 1907.</p><p>After coming back from jail, Ajit Singh decided to start a major revolt against the British. He began agitating the farmers and peasants to start a movement against them.</p><p>The British came to know of his intentions arrested him on 13 January 1911, when he was attending the Lohri festival celebration at his relative&#8217;s house. In February, Ajit Singh escaped from jail and ran away home, only to inform about his planning to start a mass struggle abroad in India. Ajit Singh bid farewell to his family and fled to Iran in March.</p><p>In 1912, Bhagat joined the District Primary School in Lyallpur received his elementary education there till class IV.&nbsp; When he was in 8th standard, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place.</p><p><strong>The very next day (on 14th April) he went to the bagh telling at his home that he was going to school.</strong></p><p>After running about 12 miles from Lahore, Bhagat reached Amritsar. At 2 pm as the boy Bhagat entered the bagh&#8217;s compound he saw blood scattered all over the ground. The turbans and torn clothes of people laid lifeless on the ground. The walls of the compound were red with blood. As it was a curfew in Punjab those days, the blood hadn&#8217;t been cleaned. Bhagat had taken a glass bottle with him before leaving from home. He took a handful of blood-stained soil and put it in the bottle. He reached home and put the bottle on in front of the Sikh gurus portrait and prayed to him for peace and solace for the victims of the massacre and he pledged to teach the British a lesson.</p><p>In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-cooperation movement to encourage a mass protest against the British and to boycott their trade in India, and to end their cooperation with British rule. Many people joined the movement and discarded the use of foreign goods and clothes. The people boycotted schools and colleges. The factories, industries, shops &amp; hospitals run by the government were all boycotted. Many students who left British schools joined Indian schools.</p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">Bhagat Singh actively participated in the movement.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A rose tattoo is one of the most prevalent patterns in the world. Both males and females embellish their bodies with this symbol, which has a very deep and complicated history.</p><p>Originally, this pattern has appeared in Persia, there a rose was considered to be only a male flower, but then diverse senses have been assigned to this pattern in divergent countries.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><p>Thus, for instance, in Greece this flower symbolized the blood of Aphrodite, in Rome it has been connected with the goddess Diana, who has transformed her lover into a rose, in Egypt it was a favorite flower of Isis, in Christian countries the rose has been associated with the blood of Christ. In the East, this flower was the sign of pure and sincere love.</p><p>In the current world, the denotation of the rose depends on its color and it doesn’t matter where the tattoo will be placed.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A black rose denotes tragic love, various subcultures invest their own meaning. Hence, for example, goths reckon that the black rose is death, for anarchists the same symbol is the fight.</li><li>A white rose shows pure love and a faithful essence of its owner.</li><li>A red rose indicates passion, desire, and love, whereas a burgundy rose spells out the idea of inner harmony.</li><li>A blue rose represents a sophisticated nature of a human, who wears it. He or she renounces all rules and foundations, adopted in the society, besides, this person strives for something unattainable.</li><li>A yellow rose has altered its meaning: at first, it meant jealousy, but now it connotes dedication.</li><li>An orange rose conveys that the owner is enthusiastic and attractive.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/rose-tattoo-2/">Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A roaring lion is an animal to be respected and feared. It is a symbol of Power and Authority and a sign that you aren&#8217;t a person to be taken lightly. Roaring lions are born leaders, gifted fighters, and, in a crunch, are the persons who can best guide the group out of danger.&nbsp;<span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s1">t</span><span class="s1">he tradition</span>, a lion whelp was still-born but brought to life by the roar of his father. The whelp later went on to create and lead the tribes of Israel. The symbolism shows that the word of the Divine (represented by the roaring Lion) has the power to breathe life into weakest being (the whelp) and transform him into a force to be reckoned with. A Roaring Lion Tattoo expresses to the world that you aren&#8217;t a pushover and that a beast lies underneath the surface, primed and ready to strike.</p><p>Aside from the basic verbal symbolism of the lion, there are some deeper meanings connected to them as well.</p><p>Lion tattoos have been placed on men throughout history. Those in Asia, Africa, India and the Middle East have put great emphasis on the lion tattoo for many centuries. Lions have always known as the king of the jungle and this status portrays great power. I think this has always been the big draw about the lion tattoo. If you think about it, the lion can also be a symbol of a religious nature.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hourglass Tattoo History</strong></p><p>Invented in Alexandria somewhere around 150 B.C., the hourglass plays an important part in the life of history. Used to measure time accurately and repeatedly, hourglasses saved the lives of many before someone invented the modern clock.</p><p><span class="keyword"><strong>Hourglass Tattoo Sleeve</strong></span></p><p>While primitive, their small measurements helped synchronize groups of people. Few alternatives match the abilities of the hourglass.</p><p><strong>Hourglass Tattoo Sleeve</strong></p><p>When the&nbsp;hourglass’s popularity spread from Egypt into northern countries, the strange depiction of time captured the hearts of artists and philosophers. It was the only symbol that could depict both the past and the present at the same time, so it came to represent both life and death. Its sands would flow regardless of the elements around it—just as a person’s life winds down at a steady pace, regardless of their good or bad deeds—so it was also used to instill a fear of death into people. Pirates adopted it for their flags, and people still place it on gravestones and coffins.</p><p>The hourglass proved most useful in nautical navigation. Mariners from Alexandria used the hourglass to measure minutes out at sea. While sailing the ocean, the constant change in wave height and angle of the sun disoriented sailors and that lead them to lose their sense of time. Hourglasses mitigated that to an extent and made sailing a much more accurate ordeal. Sailors used it to time their voyages and memorize the exact times between ports and landmarks. For those that watched the deck at night, they could compare it to the stars above. With the help of the ever-changing constellations, they navigated with accuracy.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/hourglass-tattoo-sleeve/">Hourglass Tattoo Sleeve</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="ctl01_mainContent_39661"><strong>The Five Eternal Elements</strong></p><p>When Bhagwan Swaminarayan set out on His spiritual journey at eleven years of age, He halted only after getting a reply to the question He had asked all across India. On His quest, He asked about the five eternal elements as revealed in the Vedas. He found a reasonable answer in Loj from Ramananad Swami’s chief disciple, Muktanand Swami. He accepted Ramanand Swami as His guru and then established the Swaminarayan Sampraday in Gujarat. Bhagwan Swaminarayan describes these five eternal elements and their relationship in great detail throughout the Vachanamrut.</p><p><strong>Pramukh Swami Tattoo Design,These five eternal elements are: Jiva, Ishwar, Maya, Brahma, and Parabrahma. </strong></p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl07_divpagercontrol"><strong>Jiva – The Soul</strong></p><p>One’s true identity is not this human body, but the jiva that resides within it.&nbsp;The jiva, also called ‘atma’ or soul, is eternal – it cannot be destroyed. The jiva has no gender; it is neither male nor female.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan discusses the nature of the jiva throughout the Vachanamrut.&nbsp;It is said to reside in our bodies in the same area as the heart.&nbsp;“Childhood, youth, old age, stoutness, thinness, birth and death are all aspects of the body.</p><p>On the other hand, being uncuttable, being unpierceable, not aging, being immortal, being the embodiment of gnan [wisdom], being the embodiment of bliss, and being characterized by eternal existence are all aspects of the atma; they should in no way be considered as belonging to the body.” The jiva is free and pure, but we believe that we are restrained by maya. Once we understand that we are not this body and worship Purna Purushottam Narayan, we realize that our jiva is free from the clutches of maya and is worthy of moksha. The very essence of the Brahma-Parabrahma spiritual journey is to believe one’s self to be the atma and not this body, to become atmarup, and to worship Purna Purshottam Narayan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ishwar – Divinities</strong></p><p>Ishwar transcends the jiva. It is the next element above the jiva.&nbsp;These beings partake in the creation, sustenance, and destruction of each universe.&nbsp;Ishwars are conscious spiritual beings that have greater realization than jivas.</p><p>While the jiva must work to realize its divine presence within the human body, ishwar is aware of that divinity. There are infinite ishwars, and but they are all bound by maya. Just as Purna Purshottam Narayan controls the jiva, He also controls the ishwars. Like the jivas, ishwars too aim to surpass maya and attain moksha.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl09_divpagercontrol"><strong>Maya – Ignorance</strong></p><p>Maya is the ignorance that separates the jivas and ishwars from Brahma and Parabrahma. It is the desire that hinders a spiritual aspirant’s path to moksha. Maya directly translates to attachment for worldly objects. Maya is the instrument through which Parabrahma facilitates karma and moksha. Only when a devotee is able to overcome maya overcome the darkness of attachment to worldly objects is he or she able to attain moksha. Maya manifests from physical matter, and it is difficult for the jiva or ishwar to transcend. Bhagwan Swaminarayan has advocated the jiva to engage in constant bhakti or devotion to God. To move beyond maya and towards one’s liberation.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl10_divpagercontrol"><strong>Aksharbrahma – The Eternal Abode</strong></p><p>The gunatit sadhu, Aksharbrahma, is the pathway to God and to moksha. It is only through Aksharbrahma that a jiva can associate itself with God and understand Him well enough to seek complete refuge in Him, thereby bringing the jiva out of the darkness of maya and into the light of Parabrahma. IParabrahma – GodIn the Vachanamrut, Bhagwan Swaminarayan has described this Supreme God as all-knowing, all-powerful and yet compassionate. This Parabrahma governs all the other four elements of jiva, ishwar, maya and brahma. Swaminarayan devotees believe Bhagwan Swaminarayan to be Parabrahma.&nbsp;In the Vibhuti Yoga Adhyaya of the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, Shri Krishna speaks of that Supreme God living and working through him.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan in the Vachanamrut says that Purna Purushottam Narayan resides in Akshardham and visits this Earth to establish dharma for the sake of His devotees. He is always present in human form (pragat).&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/pramukh-swami-tattoo-design/">Pramukh Swami Tattoo Design</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A warrior society in ancient Greece that reached the height of its power after defeating rival city-state Athens in the Peloponnesian War.</p><p>At age 7, Spartan boys entered a rigorous state-sponsored education, military training, and socialization program. Known as the Agoge.</p><p><strong>The system emphasized duty, discipline, and endurance.</strong></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li class="p1">Sparta, also known as Lacedaemon, an ancient Greek city-state located primarily in the present-day region of southern Greece called Laconia.</li><li>The population of Sparta consisted of three main groups: the Spartans, or Spartiates, who were full citizens; the Helots, or serfs/slaves!</li><li>And the Perioeci, who were neither slaves nor citizens.</li><li class="p1">The Perioeci, whose name means “dwellers-around,” worked as craftsmen and traders, and built weapons for the Spartans</li><li><i>The word “Spartan” means self-restrained, simple, frugal and austere. </i></li></ul><p><strong>Spartan tattoo</strong></p><p>Spartan boys started their military training at age 7 when they left home and entered the Agoge. Spartans also valued knowledge, took education seriously and even had a democratic government. They were the most feared military army in the Greek world between the 4th and 6th century.</p><p>These tattoos include a wide range of designs and here are some of the meanings associated with them. As you will see they speak to the individual’s approach to life, those around them and their beliefs.</p><p><strong>Honor</strong></p><p>Spartans had a reputation for being honorable men who would lay down their lives to protect their society, way of life and their fellow warrior. In today’s modern world honor is hard to come by, so many choose a tattoo like this to remind them that the right thing to do and the hardest thing to do are often the same and they need to make honorable choices.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/spartan-warrior-tattoo/">Spartan Warrior Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos have different connotations and the owl tattoo meaning is just among such. As a bird, the owl has been linked to many things useful in giving the best meaning to your owl tattoo. Different cultures have attached different meanings to the owl tattoo. Some of the cultures that have found interest in the owl are the Egyptian, Celtic, and Hindu among others.</p><p>The ancient Greeks revered the goddess Athena, who was supposed to be the goddess of&nbsp;<b>wisdom</b>&nbsp;and guardian of the Acropolis. Her symbol was the owl, so the bird became a symbol of higher&nbsp;<b>wisdom</b>. The owl was a bird of prophecy and wisdom<b></b>&nbsp;in many ancient cultures</p><p><b>Symbol of wisdom, education, and intelligence</b></p><p>Undeniably, the owl is a carrier of many symbols. However, this is not a big surprise because the bird’s appearance is unique. It is rarely seen especially during the day. Mostly, it can be found at night, and therefore the beliefs can be many. It represents something precious that is not easily found but through a struggle and great search.</p><p>The owl tattoo is a complicated and beautiful work of design that is very much appealing to the eye. For a long time now, the owl tattoo symbolism is connected to education and wisdom.&nbsp;The Native Americans believe the owl to be the protector of sacred knowledge, hence regard it as a symbol of intelligence.</p><p><b>Symbol of freedom and vision</b></p><p>Just like the beliefs that birds are known to be free by flying wherever they please, the owl tattoo can symbolize freedom.</p><p>The owl with its big eyes is a great hunter. It is known to look for its food in an organized quiet manner even when flapping its wings. An owl tattoo will thus be used to symbolize vision.&nbsp;Weather forecasters of ancient times used the owl in their work. It was also useful in telling important weather conditions for different seasons.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/owl-tattoo-designs/">Owl Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Wolf Head Tattoo</strong></p><p>Many different cultures throughout history, most notably with Native Americans: too numerous tribes across North America and in other parts of the world, wolves are very powerful and important.</p><p><strong>Wolves have survived in harsh locations for tens of thousands of years.</strong></p><p>They are intelligent and skillful hunters who rarely hunt alone (unless they have been cast out of the pack). Wolves live and hunt in packs, tight-knit family groups that increase their chances of survival.</p><p>Native Americans viewed the wolf as a totem animal or spirit sent to help guide us through life, symbolizing loyalty and perseverance. In legends, the wolf had great powers given by the Great Spirit. Wolves also had the power to change into people.</p><p><strong>The Wolf Head Tattoo is a very symbolic creature that holds deep meaning.</strong></p><p>Wolves are strongly associated with the family. Because they live and hunt in packs, they have survived. The pack also gives them a territorial advantage against other predators. A wolf will only mate with one partner while the pair is alive. Because they mate for life, and because the whole pack will help take care of the pups, wolves are also known as caring parents. Thus a wolf tattoo can symbolize tight family bonds.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/wolf-head-tattoo/">Wolf Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>“In photography there is a reality so subtle that it becomes more real than reality.”</strong></p><p>Ninety years ago, at the 1925 Leipzig Spring Fair in Germany,&nbsp; camera was launched that was destined to change the face of photography. This was a time when it was still common for glass plates to be used in cameras, and those that took roll film were thought of as miniatures. So imagine the culture shock when a still photography camera was produced to take 35mm movie film.</p><p>The Leica was by no means the first 35mm camera, but it was the first to make 35mm truly viable, leading to the most popular film format ever.</p><p><strong>Camera Tattoos</strong></p><p><strong>Once photographing meant a large box camera on a tripod, shifting film plate after each shot &#8211; &amp; working with a dark cloth over your head and the Camera Tattoo.</strong></p><p><strong>But then something happened&#8230;</strong></p><p>The Leica was extremely compact &amp; could be fitted with a very high quality lens. That enabled photographers to work in ordinary outdoor settings with available light. It was always instantly ready to capture life and action effortlessly. From any angle with the photographer often able to remain unnoticed.</p><p><span class="style9"><strong>Barnack&#8217;s Camera</strong></span></p><p>Oskar Barnack was headhuntet from Carl Zeiss to be the manager of the Research &amp; Development Department at Leitz. He became the designer of the Ur-Leica which he made two (possibly three) samples of in the period 1912-1913. With the purpose to test film stock and/or lenses for movie films. Or perhaps because he couldn&#8217;t carry the traditional large plate cameras and wanted a smaller camera for him self. Barnack was a film geek and moving pictures was the new revolution back in early 1900&#8217;s.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/camera-tattoos/">Vintage Camera Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Coverup Tattoo</strong></p><p>The tiger&#8217;s eye<span class="s1"><a href="http://gemstone-dictionary.com/tigers-eye">&nbsp;</a>is more than gemstone</span>; it is a symbol of Focus, Patience, and Determination. A Tiger Eye Tattoo symbolizes your most primitive desires; you are moving and thinking simply on instinct and drive. The eye of the tiger represents the animal in its purest state; it is stalking, hungry, focused, and, most importantly, lethal.</p><p><strong>Tiger Eye Tattoo Designs</strong></p><p>When it comes to animal tattoos, the tiger ranks up there with the best of them. Tigers have been a part of fashion, magic acts, and carnivals for years. Their beautiful stripes make them very attractive in fashion, art, and tattoos. Although the lion is considered to be the king of the jungle, it is actually the tiger. The largest percentage of tigers live in the dense jungles of Asia. Due to the popularity of their fur coats, they&#8217;re on the endangered species list. The beauty and symbolism of the tiger has made it a highly sought-after tattoo.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The Bengal and Siberian tigers are absolutely beautiful animals. The Bengal is orange with black stripes, while the Siberian is white with black stripes.</li><li>They are deadly jungle predators. The humans who still live in the jungles where these tigers roam have to be on constant alert for them. One of the tiger&#8217;s strengths is his ability to hunt and ambush his prey without detection.</li><li>The tiger has played a very important role in Asian cultures, such as China and Japan. In these cultures, the tiger ranks right up there with the dragon. You may also see tiger tattoos that actually have a dragon.</li><li>Japanese Samurai had tigers on their crests.</li><li>As you have already read, the tiger is an endangered animal. Due to this fact, the tiger tattoo has become very important for those who care about the tiger species and conservation. These people wear the tiger tattoo with pride as a reminder of their work.</li><li>As of today, there are only a few thousand left in the entire world. The species became endangered after people had been hunting them for their fur.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/tiger-eye-tattoo-designs/">Tiger Eye Tattoo Designs</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

I remember there is a sentence is “When the mind and hands are silenced the spirit is more focused”. There are many different meanings staying inside each tattoo. We have it to commemorate a member of the family, a relative, a friend or a person you admire who passed away. We have it to mark and raise ourselves up in hard periods in our life. Sometimes, we have it to just praying for the happiness and the health of our family. In general, the religious belief and comfort are what people aim in life.</p><p>God gave a gift to the world when you were born&#8230;Praying Hands In God&#8217;s hands lies a heart, a life that changed the world&nbsp;<strong>Praying hands symbolize obedience, submission, sincerity, repentance, veneration, and respect in regard to one&#8217;s higher power.</strong> The exact meaning of praying hands varies depending on which religious tradition is considered.</p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/"><strong>Praying hands tattoos Design Variations of the Tattoo</strong></a></p><p>The praying hands tattoo works well alone.
