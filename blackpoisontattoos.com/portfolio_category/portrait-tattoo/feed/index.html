										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk about portrait tattoos, but what exactly do they mean? What makes them so appealing? And, most importantly, is it possible to get a portrait tattoo without getting sunburnt afterward? In this article, we&#8217;ll answer all these questions and more.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beautiful-portrait-tattoo"><strong>Beautiful Portrait Tattoo</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>A portrait tattoo of a loved one&nbsp;is often one of the most popular and sought-after tattoos. These types of tattoos are usually done in black-and-white or just black. The reason for this is that it gives the tattoo a classic look that is easy to match with any style you have going on.</p><p>The most common way to get a portrait tattoo is by having it done on your arm, leg, or back. This makes it easier for you to hide the tattoo when you want to, but it also makes it very visible if you want others to see it too!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-a-portrait-tattoo-mean"><strong>What does a portrait tattoo mean?</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>A portrait tattoo is a great way to honor someone or commemorate an important time in your life. For example, you might get a portrait of your best friend to show them how much they mean to you. Or perhaps you want something special that represents your love for your partner—a portrait of theirs will be perfect! If a birthday or anniversary comes along, why not commemorate it with a unique tattoo design?</p><p>A portrait can also be used to celebrate achievements or milestones in life: if someone has graduated from college, this would be the perfect opportunity for them to add something special to their body.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-portrait-tattoos-painful"><strong>Are portrait tattoos painful?</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>Tattoos are a long process that involves the artist doing several passes with the tattoo machine before completing a design. This can cause some discomfort for you, but there are ways to minimize this pain and make your experience more comfortable.</p><p>First of all, make sure you go to a reputable tattoo shop where that uses sterile needles and ink. Also, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask about numbing creams or certain techniques that will help reduce your discomfort during the process—such as adding breaks in between sessions or using an electric handpiece instead of disposable ones (which can cause additional irritation).</p><p>Tattoos are permanent marks on your skin and they take years (or even decades) before they fade away completely! So it&#8217;s important that you&#8217;re absolutely sure about what designs you want before getting them permanently etched onto yourself!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-hours-does-a-portrait-tattoo-take"><strong>How many hours does a portrait tattoo take?</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>How long does it take to get a portrait tattoo?</p><p>Well, that&#8217;s a great question! And there are a lot of answers mixed into that one question. It depends on how big the tattoo is and where you want it placed on your body. It also depends on how experienced your tattoo artist is and what kind of equipment they use to create your design. Another important factor is how well you take care of your skin after getting the tattoo applied—but more about that later!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-is-the-best-place-to-put-a-portrait-tattoo"><strong>Where is the best place to put a portrait tattoo?</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>The best place to get a portrait tattoo is on your upper chest, just below your neck, and above your breasts. This is because it&#8217;s very visible and can be seen by other people easily. It&#8217;s also quite personal since it&#8217;s close to your heart! You will have constant reminders of who you love with every breath you take, which is why I recommend getting this type of tattoo at night or in the morning before starting your day.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-i-choose-a-portrait-tattoo"><strong>How do I choose a portrait tattoo?</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>Choosing a portrait is an important decision, so you&#8217;ll want to ensure that the tattoo you&#8217;ve chosen has meaning. You should also look at tattoos of faces in general and see if there are any other styles that appeal to you.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Make sure your tattoo is realistic, not cartoonish. For example, if your tattoo is an actual photograph of a person&#8217;s face and it looks like something out of &#8220;The Simpsons,&#8221; then maybe reconsider getting the same kind of drawing on your body.</li>

<li>Choose one that&#8217;s well-drawn and well-inked. Just because someone has been doing portraits since they were 10 years old doesn&#8217;t mean they have skills as an artist or know how to draw every feature with accuracy&#8211;or even at all! So before going under the needle (if possible), ask them about their process and whether or not they&#8217;ve ever had any formal training in art or anatomy; if not, find someone else who can do both of those things justice!</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><strong></strong></h2><p>If you’re looking for a unique tattoo idea, a portrait tattoo could be a perfect choice. Whether it’s someone in your family or even yourself (or your other half), there are so many options out there! Just make sure that you do your research before getting inked up – after all, tattoos are permanent!</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/mothers-portrait-tattoo/">Mother’s Portrait Tattoo &#8211; In memory of loved ones</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the novel, It is a shapeshifting monster who usually takes the form of <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">Pennywise</a> the Dancing Clown</i>, originating in a void containing and surrounding the Universe—a place referred to in the novel as the &#8220;Macroverse&#8221;.</p><p>In the novel, It claims that its true name is&nbsp;<b>Robert &#8220;Bob&#8221; Gray</b>, and is name &#8220;It&#8221; by the Losers Club. Throughout the book, It is generally refer to as male due to usually appearing as Pennywise. The Losers come to believe It may be female (because it lays eggs), and perceiving It&#8217;s true form as a monstrous giant spider. However, It&#8217;s true appearance is briefly observed by Bill Denbrough via the Ritual of Chüd as a mass of swirling destructive orange lights known as &#8220;deadlights&#8221;, which inflict insanity or death on any living being that sees them directly. The only person to survive the ordeal is Bill&#8217;s wife Audra Phillips, although she is rendered temporarily catatonic by the experience.</p><p>Its natural enemy is the &#8220;Space Turtle&#8221; or &#8220;Maturin&#8221;, another ancient dweller of King&#8217;s &#8220;Macroverse&#8221; who, eons ago, created the known universe and possibly others by vomiting them out as the result of a stomachache.</p><p>The Turtle appears again in King&#8217;s series&nbsp;<i>The Dark Tower</i>.&nbsp;<i>Wizard and Glass</i>, one of the novels in the series. Suggests that It, along with the Turtle, are themselves creations of a separate. Omnipotent creator referred to as &#8220;the Other&#8221; (possibly Gan.</p><p>Throughout the novel&nbsp;<i>It</i>, some events are depicts from Pennywise&#8217;s point of view. Describing itself as a &#8220;superior&#8221; being, with the Turtle as an equal and humans as mere &#8220;toys&#8221;. Its hibernation begins and ends with horrific events. Like the mysterious disappearance of the Derry Township&#8217;s 300 settlers in 1740-43 or the ironworks explosion.</p><p>It awoke during a great storm that flooded part of the city in 1957, with Bill&#8217;s younger brother Georgie. The first in a line of killings before the Losers Club fight the monster. A confrontation culminating in Bill using the Ritual of Chüd to severely wound It and force It into hibernation. Continually surprised by the Losers&#8217; victory, It briefly questions its superiority before claiming that they were only lucky. As the Turtle is working through them. Pennywise makes a tangential appearance in King&#8217;s 2011 novel <i>11/22/63</i>, in which protagonist. Jake Epping meets a couple of the children from <i>It.</i> Asks them about a recent murder in their town, and learns that the murderer apparently &#8220;wasn&#8217;t the clown.&#8221;</p><p>It also appears to Jake in the old ironworks. Where it taunts Jake about &#8220;the rabbit-hole,&#8221;. Referring to the time portal in which Jake moves from one time to another.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/penny-wise-tattoo/">Penny Wise Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bhagat Singh Tattoo &#8211; He was born to Vidyavati Kaur and Sardar Kisan Singh Sandhu. In a Sikh Jat family on 28 September 1907 in Lyallpur, Punjab in British India. His family had earlier involved in revolutionary activities against the British Raj.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">His uncle Swaran Singh had participated in the freedom struggle against the British.</a> When in 1907, another uncle of Bhagat. Ajit Singh was arrested and exiled to Rangoon in Burma (Myanmar), Swaran asked the people of Punjab to force the government for his release and due to his efforts, Ajit Singh was released from Rangoon jail in October 1907.</p><p>After coming back from jail, Ajit Singh decided to start a major revolt against the British. He began agitating the farmers and peasants to start a movement against them.</p><p>The British came to know of his intentions arrested him on 13 January 1911, when he was attending the Lohri festival celebration at his relative&#8217;s house. In February, Ajit Singh escaped from jail and ran away home, only to inform about his planning to start a mass struggle abroad in India. Ajit Singh bid farewell to his family and fled to Iran in March.</p><p>In 1912, Bhagat joined the District Primary School in Lyallpur received his elementary education there till class IV.&nbsp; When he was in 8th standard, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place.</p><p><strong>The very next day (on 14th April) he went to the bagh telling at his home that he was going to school.</strong></p><p>After running about 12 miles from Lahore, Bhagat reached Amritsar. At 2 pm as the boy Bhagat entered the bagh&#8217;s compound he saw blood scattered all over the ground. The turbans and torn clothes of people laid lifeless on the ground. The walls of the compound were red with blood. As it was a curfew in Punjab those days, the blood hadn&#8217;t been cleaned. Bhagat had taken a glass bottle with him before leaving from home. He took a handful of blood-stained soil and put it in the bottle. He reached home and put the bottle on in front of the Sikh gurus portrait and prayed to him for peace and solace for the victims of the massacre and he pledged to teach the British a lesson.</p><p>In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-cooperation movement to encourage a mass protest against the British and to boycott their trade in India, and to end their cooperation with British rule. Many people joined the movement and discarded the use of foreign goods and clothes. The people boycotted schools and colleges. The factories, industries, shops &amp; hospitals run by the government were all boycotted. Many students who left British schools joined Indian schools.</p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">Bhagat Singh actively participated in the movement. He along with a group of people used to burn foreign clothes publicly. And used to boycott foreign schools, he was only 13 years old.</a></p><p>In February 1922, In Chauri Chaura village of Gorakhpur in the United Provinces. Some policemen beat down non-violent protesters going to picket a liquor shop at night.&nbsp; This created much chaos around the common people as they thought that if Gandhi had not suspended the movement they would have easily gained freedom.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/bhagat-singh-tattoo/">Bhagat Singh Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

You may just have a special person in mind that has been there through it all. All of these are popular reasons that portrait tattoos are chosen.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/portrait-tattoo-on-chest/">Portrait Tattoo on Chest</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="ctl01_mainContent_39661"><strong>The Five Eternal Elements</strong></p><p>When Bhagwan Swaminarayan set out on His spiritual journey at eleven years of age, He halted only after getting a reply to the question He had asked all across India. On His quest, He asked about the five eternal elements as revealed in the Vedas. He found a reasonable answer in Loj from Ramananad Swami’s chief disciple, Muktanand Swami. He accepted Ramanand Swami as His guru and then established the Swaminarayan Sampraday in Gujarat. Bhagwan Swaminarayan describes these five eternal elements and their relationship in great detail throughout the Vachanamrut.</p><p><strong>Pramukh Swami Tattoo Design,These five eternal elements are: Jiva, Ishwar, Maya, Brahma, and Parabrahma. </strong></p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl07_divpagercontrol"><strong>Jiva – The Soul</strong></p><p>One’s true identity is not this human body, but the jiva that resides within it.&nbsp;The jiva, also called ‘atma’ or soul, is eternal – it cannot be destroyed. The jiva has no gender; it is neither male nor female.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan discusses the nature of the jiva throughout the Vachanamrut.&nbsp;It is said to reside in our bodies in the same area as the heart.&nbsp;“Childhood, youth, old age, stoutness, thinness, birth and death are all aspects of the body.</p><p>On the other hand, being uncuttable, being unpierceable, not aging, being immortal, being the embodiment of gnan [wisdom], being the embodiment of bliss, and being characterized by eternal existence are all aspects of the atma; they should in no way be considered as belonging to the body.” The jiva is free and pure, but we believe that we are restrained by maya. Once we understand that we are not this body and worship Purna Purushottam Narayan, we realize that our jiva is free from the clutches of maya and is worthy of moksha. The very essence of the Brahma-Parabrahma spiritual journey is to believe one’s self to be the atma and not this body, to become atmarup, and to worship Purna Purshottam Narayan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ishwar – Divinities</strong></p><p>Ishwar transcends the jiva. It is the next element above the jiva.&nbsp;These beings partake in the creation, sustenance, and destruction of each universe.&nbsp;Ishwars are conscious spiritual beings that have greater realization than jivas.</p><p>While the jiva must work to realize its divine presence within the human body, ishwar is aware of that divinity. There are infinite ishwars, and but they are all bound by maya. Just as Purna Purshottam Narayan controls the jiva, He also controls the ishwars. Like the jivas, ishwars too aim to surpass maya and attain moksha.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl09_divpagercontrol"><strong>Maya – Ignorance</strong></p><p>Maya is the ignorance that separates the jivas and ishwars from Brahma and Parabrahma. It is the desire that hinders a spiritual aspirant’s path to moksha. Maya directly translates to attachment for worldly objects. Maya is the instrument through which Parabrahma facilitates karma and moksha. Only when a devotee is able to overcome maya overcome the darkness of attachment to worldly objects is he or she able to attain moksha. Maya manifests from physical matter, and it is difficult for the jiva or ishwar to transcend. Bhagwan Swaminarayan has advocated the jiva to engage in constant bhakti or devotion to God. To move beyond maya and towards one’s liberation.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl10_divpagercontrol"><strong>Aksharbrahma – The Eternal Abode</strong></p><p>The gunatit sadhu, Aksharbrahma, is the pathway to God and to moksha. It is only through Aksharbrahma that a jiva can associate itself with God and understand Him well enough to seek complete refuge in Him, thereby bringing the jiva out of the darkness of maya and into the light of Parabrahma. IParabrahma – GodIn the Vachanamrut, Bhagwan Swaminarayan has described this Supreme God as all-knowing, all-powerful and yet compassionate. This Parabrahma governs all the other four elements of jiva, ishwar, maya and brahma. Swaminarayan devotees believe Bhagwan Swaminarayan to be Parabrahma.&nbsp;In the Vibhuti Yoga Adhyaya of the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, Shri Krishna speaks of that Supreme God living and working through him.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan in the Vachanamrut says that Purna Purushottam Narayan resides in Akshardham and visits this Earth to establish dharma for the sake of His devotees. He is always present in human form (pragat).&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/pramukh-swami-tattoo-design/">Pramukh Swami Tattoo Design</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mother Mary Tattoo Did this tattoo at Beauty &amp; Salon Expo 2015 at Ahmedabad on 21st Sep 2015</p><p><strong>Mother Mary Tattoo Design</strong></p><p>In dangers, in doubts, in difficulties, think of Mary, call upon Mary. Let not her name depart from your lips, never suffer it to leave your heart. And that you may obtain the assistance of her prayer, neglect not to walk in her footsteps. With her for guide, you shall never go astray; while invoking her, you shall never lose heart; so long as she is in your mind, you are safe from deception; while she holds your hand, you cannot fall; under her protection you have nothing to fear; if she walks before you, you shall not grow weary; if she shows you favor, you shall reach the goal.</p><p>The Virgin Mary tattoo is one of the Christian tattoos that are very popular and have been common for a long period of time. It originated from icons and paintings that could be done in churches. These paintings consisted of a lady who looked humble and beautiful and could be referred as a symbol of the Virgin Mary. Christians recognize Mary as the mother of Jesus whom she conceived by the help of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/mother-mary-tattoo-design/">Mother Mary Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
