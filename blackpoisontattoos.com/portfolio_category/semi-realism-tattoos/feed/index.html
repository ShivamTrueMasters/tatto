This care regimen guarantees that your tattoo remains a stunning work of art.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tattoos-as-storytellers">Tattoos as Storytellers</h2><p>Every tattoo tells a story. Whether it&#8217;s a representation of personal experiences, cultural heritage, or aspirations, tattoos serve as visual narratives etched onto the canvas of your skin. They spark conversations and allow you to share a piece of your journey with the world.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-breaking-stereotypes-tattoos-today">Breaking Stereotypes: Tattoos Today</h2><p>Tattoos have transcended societal stereotypes and are now embraced across various professions and cultures. No longer confined to rebellious subcultures, tattoos have become a means of self-expression, even in the most formal settings. The evolution of tattoos signifies a shift in perspective and acceptance.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faq">FAQ</h2><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-tattoo-needles-hurt">Do Tattoo Needles Hurt?</h4><p>Tattooing involves needles puncturing the skin to deposit ink. While pain tolerance varies, many people liken the sensation to a series of pinpricks. The level of discomfort depends on factors such as the tattoo&#8217;s location, individual pain threshold, and the artist&#8217;s technique.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-i-get-allergic-reactions">Can I Get Allergic Reactions?</h4><p>Allergic reactions to tattoo ink are rare but possible. Red ink and certain pigments have been associated with allergic responses. To minimize the risk, opt for reputable tattoo parlors that use high-quality ink, and consider a patch test if you have a history of allergies.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-the-ideal-tattoo-size">What&#8217;s the Ideal Tattoo Size?</h4><p>The ideal tattoo size varies based on personal preference and placement. Larger designs offer intricate details, while smaller ones are discreet. Consider factors like pain tolerance, budget, and how visible you want the tattoo to be when deciding on the size.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-long-is-the-healing-process">How Long is the Healing Process?</h4><p>Tattoo healing typically takes about 2 to 4 weeks. During this time, the skin goes through peeling and scabbing stages. Following proper aftercare instructions, such as keeping the tattoo moisturized and avoiding direct sunlight, accelerates the healing process.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-i-modify-my-tattoo-later">Can I Modify My Tattoo Later?</h4><p>Yes, tattoos can often be modified or covered up with new designs. Skilled tattoo artists can work with your existing tattoo to create a fresh design that incorporates and enhances the existing ink. Consulting with an experienced artist will provide insight into your options.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In the realm of body art, Lord Buddha and warrior tattoos stand as compelling embodiments of both spirituality and strength. Their coalescence forms a captivating narrative of balance and resilience. Whether you choose to don the serene visage of Lord Buddha or the fierce valor of a warrior, these tattoos remain a testament to the profound connection between the inner self and the outer world. So, embrace the artistry, carry the symbolism, and let your skin tell the story of your journey.</p><p>Remember, tattoos are not just ink; they are the poetry of the skin, etching chapters of life onto the canvas of the body.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-buddha-tattoo-with-warrior/">Exploring the Deep Symbolism of Lord Buddha and Warrior Tattoos</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos have been used for centuries to express personal style, beliefs, and memories. One popular tattoo design that has stood the test of time is the pocket watch tattoo with a name and birth date on the shoulder. This design not only looks beautiful but also carries a deep and personal meaning for the wearer. In this article, we will explore the origins of the pocket watch tattoo, the symbolism behind it, and how to design the perfect pocket watch tattoo with a name and birth date.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Origins of Pocket Watch Tattoos</h2><p>Pocket watch tattoos have a long history dating back to the 17th century when pocket watches were first invented. Pocket watches were once a symbol of prestige and wealth, and were often passed down as family heirlooms. The intricate designs and mechanical workings of pocket watches made them fascinating to artists, who began to incorporate them into their art and designs.</p><p>Over time, pocket watch tattoos became a popular tattoo design, especially among those who wanted to honour a loved one or commemorate a special moment in time. The addition of a name and birth date to the tattoo further personalizes the design and gives it a deeper meaning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The symbolism of Pocket Watch Tattoos</h2><p>Pocket watch tattoos symbolize the importance of time and the fleeting nature of life. The ticking of a pocket watch serves as a constant reminder to cherish every moment and to make the most of the time we have. By adding a name and birth date, the tattoo becomes a tribute to a loved one who has passed away or a reminder of a special moment in the wearer&#8217;s life.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Designing the Perfect Pocket Watch Tattoo</h2><p>When designing a pocket watch tattoo with a name and birth date, there are many factors to consider. The size, placement, and style of the tattoo will all play a role in creating the perfect design.</p><p><strong>Size and Placement:</strong> Pocket watch tattoos can be as small or as large as you want them to be. Some people prefer a small, delicate design that can be easily hidden, while others opt for a larger, more intricate design that covers their entire shoulders. The placement of the tattoo on the shoulder is also important. Many people choose to place the tattoo on their dominant shoulder so that they can easily see it throughout the day.</p><p><strong>Style:</strong> Pocket watch tattoos can be designed in many different styles, from traditional to modern. Traditional pocket watch tattoos often feature a detailed design with intricate gears and clock hands, while modern designs may be more minimalist with simple lines and shapes. The font used for the name and birth date can also influence the overall style of the tattoo.</p><p>Colour: Pocket watch tattoos can be done in black and grey or in full colour. The choice of colour will depend on personal preference and the overall design of the tattoo.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, a pocket watch tattoo with a name and birth date is a timeless and meaningful design that carries a deep personal significance for the wearer. By incorporating the symbolism of time and the fleeting nature of life, this tattoo serves as a reminder to cherish every moment and to honour those we have loved and lost. When designing a pocket watch tattoo, be sure to consider the size, placement, style, and colour of the tattoo to create the perfect design that is uniquely yours.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/pocket-watch-tattoo/">Pocket Watch Tattoo with Name &amp; Birth Date on Shoulder: Timeless and Meaningful Ink</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

You’ll get an Africanized bee tattoo and Bumble Bee Tattoo. As well as:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Honey Bee Tattoo</li><li>Queen Bee Tattoo</li><li>Carpenter Bee Tattoo</li><li>Leopard Print Bee Tattoo</li><li>Cute Small Baby Cartoon Bee Design</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-honey-bee-tattoo">Honey Bee Tattoo</h4><p>If you&#8217;re looking to get a sweet honey bee tattoo, check out the following meanings and designs.</p><p>Honey Bee Tattoo Meaning:</p><p>Honey bees are associated with many positive things like beauty, fertility, and abundance. They may symbolize love or even motherhood.</p><p>Honey Bee Tattoo Designs:</p><p>These can be found in various shapes such as butterflies, birds, and flowers as well as words like “hope” or “sweetheart”! The most popular choice seems to be flower arrangements with yellow and white petals representing honeycomb cells containing pollen from flowers that bees pollinate during springtime when flowers are blooming in abundance across North America (and elsewhere).</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bumble-bee-tattoo">Bumble Bee Tattoo</h4><p>Bumble bee tattoos are quite popular among women because they represent a sense of freedom, beauty, and power. These tiny insects are not aggressive by nature, and as a result, their tattoo designs tend to be cute and soft. The symbol of bees is also associated with creativity and fertility, so many people choose this design to enhance the feminine energy in their lives.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bumble-bee-tattoo-designs">Bumble Bee Tattoo Designs</h4><p>There are many different ways you can design your bumble bee tattoo. Here are some examples:</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-queen-bee-tattoo">Queen Bee Tattoo</h4><p>If you’re looking for a bee tattoo, you may be wondering what type of bee to get. There are many different kinds of bees out there, each with its own set of characteristics and jobs to do. A queen bee tattoo is one of the most popular designs because it’s simple and easy to recognize &#8211; the queen is usually depicted as being larger than other honeybees in her hive, and she has two sets of wings!</p><p>While many tattoos feature images of just any old bee or even an entire colony, queen bee tattoos are designed to look like a specific kind: specifically, they show an actual queen honeybee in flight. Because this species is so large compared with other insects (including worker bees), it stands out from the crowd when depicted on skin.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-africanized-bee-tattoo">Africanized Bee Tattoo</h4><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Africanized bees are significantly more aggressive than European honey bees. They will attack people who get too close to their hives, and they&#8217;re also more likely to sting someone who accidentally disturbs them.</li><li>Africanized bees are more likely to swarm than European honey bees. Swarming is when a colony of bees leaves its hive in search of a new location, sometimes in huge numbers (hundreds of thousands).</li><li>Africanized bees are more likely to chase someone away from the area around their hive, whereas European honey bee colonies tend not to do this in general (though they may chase if they feel threatened).</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-carpenter-bee-tattoo">Carpenter Bee Tattoo</h4><p>A large, black insect could be a carpenter bee. Carpenter bees are black and yellow and can be as big as a bumblebee. They have large, hairy eyes and an abdomen that’s mostly black, but with bright yellow markings on their thoraxes (the middle section of their bodies). Females have longer abdomens than males do.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leopard-print-bee-tattoo">Leopard Print Bee Tattoo</h4><p>If you are looking for the best example of a leopard print bee tattoo then look no further. The design is unique, bold, and beautiful. It&#8217;s a perfect example of how to make your own statement with this type of tattoo. The artist has created a stunning piece that has been done so well that it almost looks as if it&#8217;s made from flowers instead of ink.</p><p>This particular design is based on the Africanized honey bee which originated in Brazil but was later introduced into other countries around the world such as North America where they now thrive today due to their ability to survive environments that would normally be unsuitable for them because of climate change such as deserts where temperatures can reach up over 40°C during summer months (or “hot spells” as Americans call them).</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cute-bee-tattoo">Cute Bee Tattoo</h4><p>When you think of a tattoo, you might be imagining a large piece of art that takes up your entire back. However, there are many smaller tattoos &#8211; meaning those that fit on a small part of the body &#8211; that can be just as impactful.</p><p>Here are some tips for choosing and placing a small bee tattoo:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Think about the area of your body where you want to place this tattoo. You&#8217;ll want to consider whether or not it will be visible through clothing and if it will look good when layered with other tattoos.</li><li>Select an artist based on their portfolio and reputation for creating small tattoos like bees.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">The significance<b> of Crescent Moon on Lord Shiva’s Head</b></a></p><p>Shiva Tattva is where there is no mind and the moon signifies the mind. When there is no mind then how can this ‘no-mindedness’ be expressed and how can anybody understand it? You need a little bit of the mind to understand, experience and to express.</p><p>The no-mind, infinite consciousness requires that little bit of mind to express itself in the manifest world. So, to express that inexpressible, that little mind (crescent moon) is on the head.<br>Wisdom is beyond the mind, but it needs to be expressed with a tinge of mind and this is symbolized by the crescent moon.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Damru</strong></b></p><p><b>Damru</b>&nbsp;symbolizes the Universe which is always expanding and collapsing. From an expansion it collapses and then it re-expands, this is the process of creation.<br>If you see your heartbeat, it is not just one straight line but it is a rhythm that goes up and down. The whole world is nothing but rhythms; energy rising and collapsing to rise again. So the&nbsp;damru&nbsp;signifies that. Look at the shape of the&nbsp;damru, from expansion it collapses and again expands.</p><p>Lord shiva tattoo &#8211; The darmru is also a symbol of sound. Sound is rhythm and sound is energy. The whole universe is nothing but a wave function, it is nothing but rhythms. What does quantum physics say? It says the same thing – the whole universe is nothing but rhythms. It is just one wave (Adviata). So the damru signifies the non-dual nature of the universe.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Serpent around Lord Shiva’s Neck</strong></b></p><p>A state of samadhi where there is nothing, just the inner sky of consciousness, is Shiva; where there is alertness and no action. To describe this alertness they put a snake around Shiva’s neck. So the&nbsp;<b>serpent</b>&nbsp;is a symbol of&nbsp;<b>alertness</b>.</p><p>In the state of meditation when the eyes are closed, it gives the impression that the person is sleeping, but he is not asleep, he is alert. To express this state of consciousness, a&nbsp;<b>snake</b>&nbsp;is shown around Lord Shiva’s neck.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Trishul (Trident)-Lord shiva tattoo</strong></b></p><p><b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;represents the three aspects of consciousness – waking, dreaming and sleeping, and it represents the three&nbsp;gunas – satva, rajas&nbsp;and&nbsp;tamas. Holding a&nbsp;trishul&nbsp;(Trident) signifies that Shiva (the divinity) is above all the three states – waking, dreaming and sleeping, yet is the upholder of these three states.<br>The divinity is beyond the three gunas, but it holds the three&nbsp;gunas&nbsp;together.</p><p><b>Shul</b>&nbsp;means problems or suffering.&nbsp;<b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;means that which destroys all kind of suffering.<br>Three types of pain that arise in life:<br>1.&nbsp;Aadibhautik&nbsp;(physical)<br>2.&nbsp;Aadhyaatmik&nbsp;(spiritual) and<br>3.&nbsp;Aadidaivik&nbsp;(ethereal)<br>What relieves you from all the problems and suffering is the&nbsp;trishul. And it is in the hand of Shiva.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/shiva-shakti-tattoo/">Shiva Shakti Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Rose Tattoo</p><p>There are many myths and legends surrounding the creation of the rose. Its beauty, its fragrance, even the thorns have stories that explain the conception of this glorious flower. These rose tattoos are awesome embodiments of humans&#8217; constant attraction to a flower that has had everyone smitten since the dawn of time.</p><p>It was a symbol of love and beauty associated with the goddess, but also came to stand for secrecy after Cupid offered a rose to the God of Silence to keep quiet Venus’s affairs. In fact, Roman dining room ceilings were decorated with roses to urge guests to keep quiet about what was said at dinner, and “sub rosa” or “under the rose” still means “confidentially” today.&#8221;</p><p>The traditional red rose tattoo symbolizes love and passion. A pink rose represents grace, gratitude, and affection while purple roses have been used to symbolize royalty and enchantment.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><p>Thus, for instance, in Greece this flower symbolized the blood of Aphrodite, in Rome it has been connected with the goddess Diana, who has transformed her lover into a rose, in Egypt it was a favorite flower of Isis, in Christian countries the rose has been associated with the blood of Christ. In the East, this flower was the sign of pure and sincere love.</p><p>In the current world, the denotation of the rose depends on its color and it doesn’t matter where the tattoo will be placed.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A black rose denotes tragic love, various subcultures invest their own meaning. Hence, for example, goths reckon that the black rose is death, for anarchists the same symbol is the fight.</li><li>A white rose shows pure love and a faithful essence of its owner.</li><li>A red rose indicates passion, desire, and love, whereas a burgundy rose spells out the idea of inner harmony.</li><li>A blue rose represents a sophisticated nature of a human, who wears it. He or she renounces all rules and foundations, adopted in the society, besides, this person strives for something unattainable.</li><li>A yellow rose has altered its meaning: at first, it meant jealousy, but now it connotes dedication.</li><li>An orange rose conveys that the owner is enthusiastic and attractive.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/rose-tattoo-3/">Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Someone who gets this arachnid tatted on their body might want to send the message that they are deadly, stealthy, and not to be messed with.

Getting a tattoo with a scorpion and rose means that you are someone. Who cannot be judged and that people should be wary when trying to get close to you. Either physically or spiritually.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palms-together is beautiful in religion.We close eyes during prayer is to quiet the mind while two hands placed together is to quiet the physical body. I remember there is a sentence is “When the mind and hands are silenced the spirit is more focused”. There are many different meanings staying inside each tattoo. We have it to commemorate a member of the family, a relative, a friend or a person you admire who passed away. We have it to mark and raise ourselves up in hard periods in our life. Sometimes, we have it to just praying for the happiness and the health of our family. In general, the religious belief and comfort are what people aim in life.</p><p>God gave a gift to the world when you were born&#8230;Praying Hands In God&#8217;s hands lies a heart, a life that changed the world&nbsp;<strong>Praying hands symbolize obedience, submission, sincerity, repentance, veneration, and respect in regard to one&#8217;s higher power.</strong> The exact meaning of praying hands varies depending on which religious tradition is considered.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><strong>Praying hands tattoos Design Variations of the Tattoo</strong></a></p><p>The praying hands tattoo works well alone. But many people like to stylize the image to their own artistic likes and dislikes. As well as their own beliefs.</p><p>There are hundreds of reasons why people have a tattoo such as falling in love, separating in love. Having religion, showing personality and so on. Coming to the market of tattoos today, you will be shocked by its diversity and you as well will be easy to take a fancy to own one. If you really want to take it and you are pious, praying hands tattoo may be a good choice for you. In the world of religious tattoos, this one is sparkling like a star.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/"><strong>The koi fish is a symbol with extremely deep meaning for those who choose it as part of their body art. </strong></a></p><p>If you have been considering getting a tattoo that involves a koi fish, take the time first to learn the meaning associated with them. The traditional significance of a koi fish tattoo can vary depending on the fish’s orientation (whether it is going up or down your body) and color. You want to be sure that your koi fish tattoo conveys the desired meaning.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">Koi fish Tattoos</a> are prominent in the work of Japanese tattoo artists because of a long-standing legend of how the fish become dragons. Most of the meaning and symbolism behind the fish stems from this ancient legend. Beliefs about the meaning and direction a koi fish is swimming in vary greatly. Some theories of what it means are actually contradictory. But, if you are using a koi in your tattoo, you can choose the meaning that applies to you. Tattoos are your form of self-expression.</p><p>Koi fish are capable of adapting to many different climates and water conditions and can symbolize strength. It is inherent in a koi&#8217;s nature to swim upstream. Through the koi fish legend, you can see that they show great determination, dedication, perseverance, and success.</p><p>The black koi is associated with successfully overcoming an obstacle. This symbol is great for those who have gone through a tough battle in life and have finally made it to a place of strength. These obstacles can include depression, drug addiction, an abusive relationship, and many other situations.</p><p>Koi fish tattoos often incorporate various symbols, such as the yin-yang symbol, water, and fire, dragons, or lotus flowers.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/koi-fish-tattoo/">Koi Fish Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the novel, It is a shapeshifting monster who usually takes the form of <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">Pennywise</a> the Dancing Clown</i>, originating in a void containing and surrounding the Universe—a place referred to in the novel as the &#8220;Macroverse&#8221;.</p><p>In the novel, It claims that its true name is&nbsp;<b>Robert &#8220;Bob&#8221; Gray</b>, and is name &#8220;It&#8221; by the Losers Club. Throughout the book, It is generally refer to as male due to usually appearing as Pennywise. The Losers come to believe It may be female (because it lays eggs), and perceiving It&#8217;s true form as a monstrous giant spider. However, It&#8217;s true appearance is briefly observed by Bill Denbrough via the Ritual of Chüd as a mass of swirling destructive orange lights known as &#8220;deadlights&#8221;, which inflict insanity or death on any living being that sees them directly. The only person to survive the ordeal is Bill&#8217;s wife Audra Phillips, although she is rendered temporarily catatonic by the experience.</p><p>Its natural enemy is the &#8220;Space Turtle&#8221; or &#8220;Maturin&#8221;, another ancient dweller of King&#8217;s &#8220;Macroverse&#8221; who, eons ago, created the known universe and possibly others by vomiting them out as the result of a stomachache.</p><p>The Turtle appears again in King&#8217;s series&nbsp;<i>The Dark Tower</i>.&nbsp;<i>Wizard and Glass</i>, one of the novels in the series. Suggests that It, along with the Turtle, are themselves creations of a separate. Omnipotent creator referred to as &#8220;the Other&#8221; (possibly Gan.</p><p>Throughout the novel&nbsp;<i>It</i>, some events are depicts from Pennywise&#8217;s point of view. Describing itself as a &#8220;superior&#8221; being, with the Turtle as an equal and humans as mere &#8220;toys&#8221;. Its hibernation begins and ends with horrific events. Like the mysterious disappearance of the Derry Township&#8217;s 300 settlers in 1740-43 or the ironworks explosion.</p><p>It awoke during a great storm that flooded part of the city in 1957, with Bill&#8217;s younger brother Georgie. The first in a line of killings before the Losers Club fight the monster. A confrontation culminating in Bill using the Ritual of Chüd to severely wound It and force It into hibernation. Continually surprised by the Losers&#8217; victory, It briefly questions its superiority before claiming that they were only lucky. As the Turtle is working through them. Pennywise makes a tangential appearance in King&#8217;s 2011 novel <i>11/22/63</i>, in which protagonist. Jake Epping meets a couple of the children from <i>It.</i> Asks them about a recent murder in their town, and learns that the murderer apparently &#8220;wasn&#8217;t the clown.&#8221;</p><p>It also appears to Jake in the old ironworks.

This large, blackbird has long been one of the smartest animals on earth, a lover of shiny objects, and perhaps even an intuitive trickster.</p><p>Wolf tattoos are very popular and consider to be the mainstream tattoos. They can be design in a variety of different ways and portrayed with different elements and symbols. Just like all animal tattoos, the wolf tattoo represents the traits and attributes of the wolf. The wolf is a very symbolic creature that holds deep meaning for many different cultures. Throughout history, most notably with Native Americans. To numerous tribes across North America and in other parts of the world, wolves are very powerful and important.</p><p>The eye of Providence design is also by the secret society of the Free Masons, DARPA.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>History and Background</b></p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">Lord Krishna</a>, the eighth avatar of God Vishnu is worshiped as a supreme God in Hinduism. Born in northern India (around 3,228 BCE), Lord Krishna’s life marks the passing of the Dvapara age and beginning of the Kal yuga (which is also considered as the current age).Krishna Tattoo</p><p>References to Lord Krishna can be found in several Hindu mythological books, especially in the epic Hindu book, the Mahabharata.</p><p>Lord Krishna is also described as an important figure in the Bhagavata Purana. This is another Hindu epic book that dates to the 10th century B.C. In the text, Lord Krishna is described as the charioteer for the warrior Arjuna who had guided him morally and gave military counsel to the leader.</p><p>The divine birth</p><p>There came a time when Mother Earth was unable to bear the sins and cruelty committed by evil kings and rulers. Mother Earth then prayed to Lord Brahma, the creator of the Universe, to relieve her from these sinful kings. Lord Brahma prayed to the supreme Lord Vishnu for reincarnation and to relieve the Mother Earth from these evil rulers. Lord Vishnu accepted the request and assured to defeat tyrannical forces.</p><p>The ruler of Mathura, Kansa was one such evil king. He had a sister named Devaki, who was married to Vasudeva. The day Devaki and Vasudeva got married, a voice from the sky forecasted that Devaki&#8217;s eighth son will bring an end to Kansa’s rule and will kill him.Krishna Tattoo</p><p>Frightened Kansa held the couple. He then vowed that he will kill every child of Devaki and Vasudeva. Seeing their first seven children being killed by the cruel Kansa, the imprisoned couple feared giving birth to their eighth child.</p><p><strong>One night Lord Vishnu appeared before them.</strong></p><p>He told them that in the guise of their son, he will return and rescue them from Kansa&#8217;s autocracy.</p><p>The divine baby was born and the day he was born, Vasudeva found himself magically freed from prison. He ran away with the infant to a safer house and Lord Vishnu removed all the obstacles from Vasudeva&#8217;s path.</p><p>Vasudeva reached a house in Gokul, exchanged Lord Krishna with a new born girl of Yashoda and Nanda and returned to the prison with the girl child. As soon as Kansa came to know about the new-born, he again tried to kill the child. The infant ascends to the heavens and transformed into the goddess Yogamaya and said, &#8220;O foolish Kansa! What will you get by killing me? Your nemesis is already born.”Krishna Tattoo</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">Krishna</a> was raised as a cowherd in Gokul and became a skilful musician. On his return to Mathura, he slayed Kansa and restored his father to power.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/krishna-tattoo-2/">Krishna Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meaning of the gladiator tattoo for men is quite obvious, and it is known to every young man who once watched the eponymous film with Russell Crowe. The word itself derives from the Latin word “gladius”, which is translated as “sword”.</p><p>In those distant times, gladiators were enslaved people, slaves or soldiers and criminals taken prisoners during the battles. All of them were previously taught how to handle the sword correctly.</p><p><strong>Gladiator Tattoo</strong></p><p>As soon as gladiators got the necessary skills, they were confronted with each other. Such massacres resulted in the death of one of them. The bloody battles in Ancient Rome had been held in arenas for seven hundred years.&nbsp;At first, the Romans preferred to arrange such fights on holidays.</p><p>They wanted to satisfy the cruel god of war Mars in such a way. Over time, they began to hold such battles for entertainment without much reason. The Romans borrowed offering up sacrifices in the form of gladiatorial games from the Egyptians, Etruscans, and Greeks. This is easily explained by the fact that various peoples, who either were conquered or voluntarily joined, lived throughout the Empire.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/gladiator-tattoo/">Gladiator Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The History of the Dove Symbol</strong></p><p>The dove ranks as one of the most widely-known symbols around the world, universally representing peace and love. Due to the symbol’s wide recognition, these tattoos are popular all around the globe.</p><p><strong>The dove embodies a variety of positive meanings.</strong></p><p><strong>Enduring Love</strong>. Because doves mate with one partner for the duration of their lives and also take care of their young together, they represent steadfast love and devotion. The bond between the mated pair is a lifelong, enduring, and faithful partnership.</p><p><strong>Mythological Significance</strong>. The dove is also mentioned in Greek and Roman mythology: the Greek goddess Aphrodite, the goddess of love and fertility, was said to ride in a chariot borne by doves. Her seven daughters (known as the Pleiades) are referred to as a flock of doves in Greek mythology. Some tribes believed that the spirits of the dead are transformed into doves. Some American Indians may use the dove tattoo to represent this association.</p><p><strong>Dove and Rose Tattoo</strong></p><p><strong>Peace and Harmony.</strong>&nbsp;Since early Christianity, the dove holding an olive branch in its beak has represented a symbol of peace. Ironically, the image of a dove holding a grenade has become quite popular as well.</p><p><strong>Holy Spirit.</strong>&nbsp;The dove is commonly associated with Jesus and Christianity. Many examples of Christian art depict Jesus accompanied by a flock of doves. Doves are mentioned often in the Bible, for example in the story of Noah&#8217;s Ark. Before the great flood, God ordered Noah to build a ark for him and his family and to gather all the animals in pairs, one male and one female. God then flooded the earth and everything was destroyed. After several weeks at sea, Noah sent out a dove and a raven to look for signs of land. When the dove returned with an olive branch in its beak, this was a sign that life would start over.</p><p><strong>The Messenger</strong>. There are many stories about the dove carrying messages, sometimes messages from God, sometimes love letters. The dove is commonly interpreted as a portent of love, victory, peace, or God&#8217;s will.</p><p><strong>Peace and Harmony.</strong>&nbsp;Since early Christianity, the dove holding an olive branch in its beak has represented a symbol of peace.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Om and Its Meaning in Hinduism</strong></p><p>As we mentioned before, the Om symbol has various meanings and uses throughout Hinduism. Now, we will have a look at some of the most common and well-known meanings of the Om symbol in the religion.</p><p>According to Hindu beliefs, “the essence of all beings on earth, the essence of earth is water, the essence of water are plants, the essence of plants are men, the essence of men is the speech, the essence of speech is the Rig Veda, the essence of the Rig Veda is the Sama Veda, and the essence of Sama Veda is Om.”</p><p>The older Upanishads also state that the Om symbol represents the struggle between the gods and demons. This is not actually meant to represent true gods and demons, but the inclinations of good and evil within humans. In other words, it is allegorical in nature.</p><p>Also, the Om symbol is implied to be that thing in humans which inspires good and altruistic actions and thoughts.</p><p>On a side note, within the Mandukya Upanishad, Om is mentioned as “the syllable of the whole world.”</p><p>In the first verse of this Upanishad, it states that time is made of three parts. The past, present, and future, or in other words A, U, and M.</p><p>Subsequent verses suggest that the Om is something like an “acknowledgment. A melodic confirmation, and something that gives energy to a hymn”.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/om-tattoo/">Om Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More popularly known in Asian cultures such as in Japan, cherry blossoms have various meanings. They have become a national symbol for the country and they have been known to be celebrating amazing cherry blossom festivals all throughout spring. Not only does the flower have national symbolism it also has cultural impact as well. Primarily it is believed to be a symbol of joy and love; it also helps strengthen the spirit and promotes the beauty of life. Cherry blossoms only bloom in spring and they disappear again after a short time which symbolizes how people should value and appreciate life as it lasts.</p><p>The Japanese cherry blossom is interpreted as &#8216;transient of life&#8217;, since it is very fragile and has a short blooming period. There is an old story attached to this tree that values sacrifice. It is said that there is a&nbsp;<i>Jiu-roku-zakura</i>(the Cherry tree of the Sixteenth day), in the Iyo district of the country. This tree grew on the lands of a Samurai for over a hundred years. When the Samurai became old, the tree began to die. The Samurai felt really bad for the tree. He was a brave and honorable man. Hence, he thought up of a way to save the tree&#8217;s life.</p><p>He sat under the tree and committed a ritual suicide right there. This act gave the essence of the Samurai&#8217;s life to the tree. Within one hour of the Samurai&#8217;s death, on the 16th day of the month. The tree began to blossom and continues to live even today. Hence, the cherry blossom tree harbors many spiritual beliefs. These beliefs are set deep within the fundamental teachings of the Buddha.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/cherry-blossom-flower-tattoo/">Cherry Blossom Flower Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The compass tattoo has been a popular choice among a majority of cultures for centuries. This maritime symbol was popular among early sailors. Getting a compass tattoo would protect them. On rough waters and ensure that you would return home safely.</p><p>One of the main reasons sailors opted for this tattoo was that of protection. As a token of good luck, images of compasses painted on the ships as well. The seas were rough and unforgiving. Often times ships and the men onboard would disappear without a trace so these images served as a beacon of hope that they would be guided out of the treacherous waters alive.</p><p>Compass tattoos can come in a variety of styles and variations. These include,&nbsp;star compass, astrocompass, lodestone compass, Vegvisir compass and prismatic compass.</p><p><strong>The star compass is the most popular of the aforementioned designs and is said to represent the North Star.</strong></p><p>Before maps and technology existed, humans used the North Star to guide them in the right direction. Because of this, this style of tattoo stands for guidance, direction and finding a way home.</p><p>A way of depicting this is to include an image of a clock or hourglass with the compass in the tattoo design. Maps and earth play a role as well as maps, like compasses, help a user determine their location.</p><p>Compass tattoos have also represented the ideal of following one’s dreams. It is symbolic of staying your course in life and to not give up no matter how rough things may seem.</p><p>The compass will guide you where you need to be.</p><p>Overall, this type of tattoo conveys guidance and direction, but you may add additional design elements to your tattoo to have it depict a meaning that is significant to you.</p><p>#compasstattoo #ClockAndCompassTattoo #Compass #tattoo #tattoos #girlswithtattoos #tattooed #tattooartist #tattooart #tattooedgirls #guyswithtattoos #instatattoo #tattoolife #tattoodesign #traditionaltattoo #tattooflash #tattooist #tattoogirl #handtattoo #tattooedgirl #sleevetattoo #tattooing #tattooshop #blacktattoo #chesttattoo #tattoosofinstagram #rosetattoo #blackandgreytattoo #tattoomodel #tattooer #colortattoo</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/anchor-compass-tattoo/">Anchor Compass Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A roaring lion is an animal to be respected and feared. It is a symbol of Power and Authority and a sign that you aren&#8217;t a person to be taken lightly. Roaring lions are born leaders, gifted fighters, and, in a crunch, are the persons who can best guide the group out of danger.&nbsp;<span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s1">t</span><span class="s1">he tradition</span>, a lion whelp was still-born but brought to life by the roar of his father. The whelp later went on to create and lead the tribes of Israel. The symbolism shows that the word of the Divine (represented by the roaring Lion) has the power to breathe life into weakest being (the whelp) and transform him into a force to be reckoned with. A Roaring Lion Tattoo expresses to the world that you aren&#8217;t a pushover and that a beast lies underneath the surface, primed and ready to strike.</p><p>Aside from the basic verbal symbolism of the lion, there are some deeper meanings connected to them as well.</p><p>Lion tattoos have been placed on men throughout history. Those in Asia, Africa, India and the Middle East have put great emphasis on the lion tattoo for many centuries. Lions have always known as the king of the jungle and this status portrays great power. I think this has always been the big draw about the lion tattoo. If you think about it, the lion can also be a symbol of a religious nature. King of the Jungle – King of Kings.</p><p><b>Ancient Civilizations</b></p><p>The lion has been portrayed for many years in ancient cultures, legends, mythology, astrology, literature, movies, and much more. In a few ancient civilizations, lions were owned by kings and royalty. The lion was a symbol of power to the people of the king&#8217;s&nbsp;power&nbsp;and&nbsp;strength. In an interesting contrast, in Roman mythology, the lion is associated with&nbsp;love.</p><p>The lion was also symbolic to the Egyptians they often portrayed two lions with their backs to one another. These statues represented&nbsp;balance, which was very important to the Egyptians. They would usually place these statues outside of sacred structures. The Egyptians believed in balance, such as sunrise sunset and east-west their lion statues represented this all-important balance.</p><p><strong>Religion</strong></p><p>The lion is also a symbol of Christianity. Some Christians use the lion tattoo to symbolize Christian beliefs. The lion is also a symbolic figure to Islam, in which the lion and the sword represent power. The lion is also a solar animal. This means that the lion has sun-like qualities and characteristics. In many culture and beliefs, the lion is associated with the sun. It is said that the the lion&#8217;s mane looks like the rays of the sun—a trait that many tattoos often highlight. In other ancient myths, the lion represents the&nbsp;transformation&nbsp;and journey from childhood to adulthood.</p><p><strong>Culture</strong></p><p>The lion is also very symbolic to the Chinese. It represents a symbol of good luck,&nbsp;guardianship, and power. The Chinese also believe that the lion is a symbol of the earth and sun. Many people know that the lion &#8220;Leo&#8221; is part of the Zodiac. Leo is the 5th sign of the Zodiac, and anyone born between July 23-August 22 is considered to be a Leo. People born during this time are very highly energetic and are good hearted people. The Leo is somewhat timid and enjoys control, but they are very generous. The Leo also represents balance.</p><p>As you now know, the lion has been portrayed throughout human history and they have been symbolic figures for many years. It is one of the most symbolic animal tattoos that are available. Due to all the different meanings it holds, it is highly sought after in the tattoo world. There are also a variety of different designs and styles for it as well. There are tribal designs and Celtic designs, and many more. Before choosing a final design, make sure you check out every style and design that is available. Make sure you choose a design that you are satisfied with.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lion-tattoos-on-arm-2/">Lion Tattoos on Arm</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="ctl01_mainContent_39661"><strong>The Five Eternal Elements</strong></p><p>When Bhagwan Swaminarayan set out on His spiritual journey at eleven years of age, He halted only after getting a reply to the question He had asked all across India. On His quest, He asked about the five eternal elements as revealed in the Vedas. He found a reasonable answer in Loj from Ramananad Swami’s chief disciple, Muktanand Swami. He accepted Ramanand Swami as His guru and then established the Swaminarayan Sampraday in Gujarat. Bhagwan Swaminarayan describes these five eternal elements and their relationship in great detail throughout the Vachanamrut.</p><p><strong>Pramukh Swami Tattoo Design,These five eternal elements are: Jiva, Ishwar, Maya, Brahma, and Parabrahma. </strong></p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl07_divpagercontrol"><strong>Jiva – The Soul</strong></p><p>One’s true identity is not this human body, but the jiva that resides within it.&nbsp;The jiva, also called ‘atma’ or soul, is eternal – it cannot be destroyed. The jiva has no gender; it is neither male nor female.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan discusses the nature of the jiva throughout the Vachanamrut.&nbsp;It is said to reside in our bodies in the same area as the heart.&nbsp;“Childhood, youth, old age, stoutness, thinness, birth and death are all aspects of the body.</p><p>On the other hand, being uncuttable, being unpierceable, not aging, being immortal, being the embodiment of gnan [wisdom], being the embodiment of bliss, and being characterized by eternal existence are all aspects of the atma; they should in no way be considered as belonging to the body.” The jiva is free and pure, but we believe that we are restrained by maya. Once we understand that we are not this body and worship Purna Purushottam Narayan, we realize that our jiva is free from the clutches of maya and is worthy of moksha. The very essence of the Brahma-Parabrahma spiritual journey is to believe one’s self to be the atma and not this body, to become atmarup, and to worship Purna Purshottam Narayan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ishwar – Divinities</strong></p><p>Ishwar transcends the jiva. It is the next element above the jiva.&nbsp;These beings partake in the creation, sustenance, and destruction of each universe.&nbsp;Ishwars are conscious spiritual beings that have greater realization than jivas.</p><p>While the jiva must work to realize its divine presence within the human body, ishwar is aware of that divinity. There are infinite ishwars, and but they are all bound by maya. Just as Purna Purshottam Narayan controls the jiva, He also controls the ishwars. Like the jivas, ishwars too aim to surpass maya and attain moksha.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl09_divpagercontrol"><strong>Maya – Ignorance</strong></p><p>Maya is the ignorance that separates the jivas and ishwars from Brahma and Parabrahma. It is the desire that hinders a spiritual aspirant’s path to moksha. Maya directly translates to attachment for worldly objects. Maya is the instrument through which Parabrahma facilitates karma and moksha. Only when a devotee is able to overcome maya overcome the darkness of attachment to worldly objects is he or she able to attain moksha. Maya manifests from physical matter, and it is difficult for the jiva or ishwar to transcend. Bhagwan Swaminarayan has advocated the jiva to engage in constant bhakti or devotion to God. To move beyond maya and towards one’s liberation.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl10_divpagercontrol"><strong>Aksharbrahma – The Eternal Abode</strong></p><p>The gunatit sadhu, Aksharbrahma, is the pathway to God and to moksha. It is only through Aksharbrahma that a jiva can associate itself with God and understand Him well enough to seek complete refuge in Him, thereby bringing the jiva out of the darkness of maya and into the light of Parabrahma. IParabrahma – GodIn the Vachanamrut, Bhagwan Swaminarayan has described this Supreme God as all-knowing, all-powerful and yet compassionate. This Parabrahma governs all the other four elements of jiva, ishwar, maya and brahma. Swaminarayan devotees believe Bhagwan Swaminarayan to be Parabrahma.&nbsp;In the Vibhuti Yoga Adhyaya of the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, Shri Krishna speaks of that Supreme God living and working through him.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan in the Vachanamrut says that Purna Purushottam Narayan resides in Akshardham and visits this Earth to establish dharma for the sake of His devotees. He is always present in human form (pragat).&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/pramukh-swami-tattoo-design/">Pramukh Swami Tattoo Design</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
