										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoo art has always been a medium for self-expression, often reflecting an individual&#8217;s personality, beliefs, or experiences through permanent ink designs.</p><p>In the case of a particularly striking tattoo, a unique blend of whimsical humor and dark, intricate imagery creates a fascinating visual statement.</p><p>This tattoo showcases a skeletal figure wearing a jester&#8217;s hat, with two phrases encircling it: &#8220;Why so serious?&#8221; and &#8220;Hakuna Matata.&#8221;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fusion-of-contrasting-themes">The Fusion of Contrasting Themes</h3><p>The tattoo masterfully combines elements that are traditionally seen as opposites.</p><p>On one hand, the iconic phrase &#8220;Why so serious?&#8221; &#8211; popularized by the Joker in &#8220;The Dark Knight&#8221; &#8211; conjures a sense of deep, unsettling introspection about the darker sides of human nature.</p><p>On the other hand, &#8220;Hakuna Matata,&#8221; a Swahili phrase meaning &#8220;no worries,&#8221; brings in lightness and a carefree attitude, famously featured in the cheerful context of Disney&#8217;s &#8220;The Lion King.&#8221;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-artistic-details-and-symbolism">Artistic Details and Symbolism</h3><p>The detailed execution of the skull within the design is not just a representation of mortality or macabre but is stylized with exaggerated features typical of a jester.</p><p>This not only adds a layer of irony but also deepens the narrative by blending the seriousness of existential themes with the light-hearted dismissal of such worries.</p><p>The jester‚Äôs hat, embellished with bells, traditionally symbolizes folly and jest, yet here it is worn by a skull, perhaps hinting at the foolishness of ignoring the inevitability of death.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cultural-and-personal-significance">Cultural and Personal Significance</h3><p>This tattoo could be interpreted as a reflection of the wearer‚Äôs philosophy of life‚Äîbalancing the gravity of life&#8217;s inevitable challenges with a spirited, positive outlook.</p><p>It serves as a permanent reminder to not take life too seriously, thus resonating with a broad audience who find themselves oscillating between these two extremes.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>The tattoo not only stands as a piece of personal art but also engages with viewers by presenting a narrative that is open to interpretation.</p><p>Its ability to juxtapose profound depth with whimsical levity makes it a remarkable example of modern tattoo artistry.</p><p>This design not only catches the eye but also stimulates a deeper reflection on the balance of life&#8217;s dark and light moments.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/why-so-serious-hakuna-matata-tattoo/">üòØ Why so serious?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos are a deeply personal expression, and for many, they hold spiritual significance. One of the most awe-inspiring designs gaining popularity in the tattoo world is the fusion of <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong>, the <strong>Shivling</strong>, and <strong>Ram-Ram chants</strong>. This divine combination is not only visually powerful but also packed with spiritual symbolism, making it a meaningful choice for those looking to honor their faith and devotion.</p><p>In this blog, we‚Äôll explore the significance of this fusion tattoo, what each element represents, and why it‚Äôs an amazing design choice for anyone looking to blend faith and art.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-symbolism-behind-each-element">The Symbolism Behind Each Element</h3><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-lord-hanuman">1. <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong></h4><p>Lord Hanuman, one of the most revered deities in Hinduism, is the epitome of strength, devotion, and loyalty. Known as the mighty monkey god, he played a pivotal role in the <strong>Ramayana</strong>, serving as Lord Rama‚Äôs most loyal devotee. Hanuman is also seen as the protector, someone who guards against evil forces. His inclusion in a tattoo is often a mark of protection, courage, and immense dedication to a higher power.</p><p>For those who look to embody his fearless spirit, strength, and unwavering devotion, a Hanuman tattoo is a powerful symbol. Many designs capture him in his most iconic form‚Äîholding a mountain or ripping open his chest to reveal Lord Rama and Sita inside, showcasing his deep devotion.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-shivling">2. <strong>Shivling</strong></h4><p>The <strong>Shivling</strong> represents the infinite power and energy of <strong>Lord Shiva</strong>, the destroyer of evil and transformer of the universe. It signifies the balance of creation and destruction, serving as a reminder of life‚Äôs cyclical nature. For many, the Shivling is a powerful representation of their connection to the universe and their desire to remain in harmony with nature.</p><p>In tattoo designs, the Shivling is often depicted with vibrant shading and intricate detail, symbolizing Lord Shiva‚Äôs cosmic energy. It pairs beautifully with Lord Hanuman, as Hanuman is often considered an incarnation or devotee of Lord Shiva, thus blending their energies in one stunning design.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-ram-ram-chants">3. <strong>Ram-Ram Chants</strong></h4><p>The repeated chanting of <strong>‚ÄúRam-Ram‚Äù</strong> holds a unique place in the hearts of Hindu devotees. Lord Rama is the epitome of virtue and righteousness, and the continuous chanting of his name is believed to purify the soul and bring peace. Ram-Ram chants are often used in prayers and meditation as a form of devotion and mindfulness.</p><p>In tattoo art, these chants can be incorporated into the design in beautiful flowing scripts. The <strong>Devanagari script</strong>, in particular, is favored for its traditional look and adds a sense of spiritual depth to the tattoo. The repetitive mantra not only reinforces one‚Äôs devotion to Lord Rama but also serves as a constant reminder of inner peace and moral guidance.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-fusion-tattoo-is-powerful">Why This Fusion Tattoo is Powerful</h3><p>Combining <strong>Lord Hanuman, the Shivling, and Ram-Ram chants</strong> into a single tattoo creates a multi-dimensional piece of art that carries deep personal and spiritual meaning. Here&#8217;s why it&#8217;s such a compelling design:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Spiritual Significance</strong> ‚Äì Each element carries its weight of devotion, protection, and divine energy. Together, they create a strong visual and spiritual statement about the wearer‚Äôs faith.</li>

<li><strong>Personalized Design</strong> ‚Äì The fusion of these elements allows for a highly customized tattoo, as each aspect can be styled according to personal preferences‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs focusing more on Hanuman‚Äôs features or highlighting the flow of the chants around the Shivling.</li>

<li><strong>Symbol of Protection and Strength</strong> ‚Äì Hanuman‚Äôs presence symbolizes strength and loyalty, while the Shivling adds the element of cosmic energy and divine balance. The Ram-Ram chants tie the design together as a spiritual shield, protecting the wearer from negativity and evil forces.</li>

<li><strong>Cultural Reverence</strong> ‚Äì These symbols represent key deities and beliefs in Hinduism, making the tattoo a form of cultural homage. It connects the wearer to their roots and serves as a visual reminder of their spiritual journey.</li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-design-inspirations-and-ideas">Design Inspirations and Ideas</h3><p>If you‚Äôre considering getting this fusion tattoo, there are several creative ways to bring these elements together:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Backpiece Masterpiece</strong>: One popular approach is to make this tattoo a large backpiece, with Hanuman as the central figure, the Shivling below, and the Ram-Ram chants flowing around them. This style allows for detailed artistry and can convey a full narrative of devotion.</li>

<li><strong>Forearm or Sleeve Design</strong>: For those looking for a smaller or more compact version, a forearm tattoo can focus on Hanuman‚Äôs face, with the Shivling subtly incorporated and the Ram-Ram chants woven into the background. This design maintains clarity while using space efficiently.</li>

<li><strong>Minimalist Fusion</strong>: A minimalist approach could include a small Shivling with Hanuman‚Äôs face in silhouette form, with Ram-Ram chants delicately scripted around it. This design is ideal for those wanting a more subtle but deeply meaningful tattoo.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-key-considerations">Key Considerations</h3><p>When getting this tattoo, remember to:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Choose the Right Artist</strong>: Make sure your tattoo artist has experience with intricate designs and understands the spiritual significance behind these elements. You want the symbols to be respected and accurately depicted.</li>

<li><strong>Placement Matters</strong>: The placement of this tattoo can impact its visibility and size. Consider where you want to display this personal piece of art‚Äîwhether on a more private part of the body or prominently where others can admire it.</li>

<li><strong>Customization</strong>: Don‚Äôt be afraid to tweak the design to make it personal to you. Whether you want a more modern take on the Shivling or a detailed portrait of Hanuman, the design can be tailored to fit your vision.</li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3><p>A fusion tattoo of <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong>, the <strong>Shivling</strong>, and <strong>Ram-Ram chants</strong> is not just a body art choice; it‚Äôs a spiritual journey etched into your skin. This design is a beautiful homage to Hindu deities, encapsulating strength, protection, and devotion. Whether you&#8217;re deeply religious or simply admire the cultural significance, this tattoo can be a meaningful and visually stunning addition to your body art collection.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/the-ultimate-fusion-tattoo-lord-hanuman-shivling-and-ram-ram-chants/">The Ultimate Fusion Tattoo: Lord Hanuman, Shivling, and Ram-Ram Chants</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of Hindu symbolism offers a treasure trove of imagery for meaningful tattoos. Among these, the Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo stands out as a powerful representation of inner transformation and spiritual guidance. This blog post delves into the symbolism behind this unique design, exploring its historical significance and potential interpretations for the modern wearer.</p><p><strong>The Dance of Destruction and Renewal</strong></p><p>Shiva, the Hindu god of transformation, is often depicted in the ecstatic dance of Tandava. This cosmic dance represents the continual cycle of creation, destruction, and renewal within the universe. The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo frequently features Shiva in this dynamic pose, his body adorned with serpents and flames, symbolizing the transformative power he wields.</p><p><strong>The Guiding Presence of the Rishi</strong></p><p>Juxtaposed against Shiva&#8217;s energetic dance is the serene figure of a Rishi, a wise sage or seer. The Rishi acts as a counterpoint to Shiva&#8217;s dynamism, representing the wisdom and guidance needed to navigate the transformative process. In the tattoo, the Rishi is often depicted in a meditative posture, offering a sense of grounding and spiritual insight.</p><p><strong>Unveiling the Layers of Meaning</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo resonates with wearers on multiple levels. Here&#8217;s a deeper look at the symbolism it embodies:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Transformation and Rebirth:</strong> Shiva&#8217;s dance signifies the constant change inherent in life. By incorporating this image, the wearer acknowledges their own journey of growth and transformation.</li>

<li><strong>Inner Power and Destruction of Ego:</strong> The flames surrounding Shiva represent the burning away of illusion and ego. The tattoo serves as a reminder of the potential for immense inner power that lies within each of us.</li>

<li><strong>Seeking Guidance and Wisdom:</strong> The Rishi embodies the wisdom and knowledge needed to navigate life&#8217;s challenges. The tattoo signifies the wearer&#8217;s openness to guidance and spiritual growth.</li>

<li><strong>Balance and Duality:</strong> The contrasting figures of Shiva and the Rishi represent the inherent duality within the universe ‚Äì destruction and creation, chaos and order. The tattoo serves as a reminder of the importance of finding balance within oneself.</li></ul><p><strong>Beyond Symbolism: Personal Interpretations</strong></p><p>The beauty of the Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo lies in its ability to hold personal meaning for the wearer. Some interpretations include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>A Commitment to Spiritual Growth:</strong> The tattoo can symbolize a dedication to self-discovery and a willingness to embrace life&#8217;s transformative experiences.</li>

<li><strong>Overcoming Challenges:</strong> It can represent the courage to face inner demons and emerge stronger from difficult times.</li>

<li><strong>Honoring Lineage and Tradition:</strong> The Rishi can signify a connection to one&#8217;s spiritual lineage or a particular guru who has offered guidance.</li></ul><p><strong>Considering the Design</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo can be rendered in various artistic styles, from traditional Hindu art forms like Kolam or Madhubani to contemporary black and grey or vibrant illustrative styles. The choice of style ultimately depends on the wearer&#8217;s personal preferences and the desired level of detail.</p><p><strong>Placement and Size</strong></p><p>The size and placement of the tattoo can also hold significance. A larger, more elaborate design on the back or chest can represent a deep commitment to the symbolism, while a smaller, more discreet piece on the arm or ankle might offer a more personal reminder.</p><p><strong>Finding the Right Artist</strong></p><p>Given the intricate nature of the design, choosing a skilled tattoo artist with experience in Hindu iconography is crucial. Look for an artist who can capture the essence of the symbolism and translate it into a visually stunning and culturally respectful tattoo.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: A Powerful Talisman for Inner Transformation</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo is more than just a decorative piece of body art. It&#8217;s a powerful symbol that can serve as a constant reminder of the transformative potential within each of us. By understanding the rich symbolism behind this design, you can embark on a journey of self-discovery and embrace the power of inner transformation.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/shiva-rishi-tattoo/">Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos have been used as a form of self-expression and body art for centuries, with different designs symbolizing various meanings. One such popular design is the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe. This design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also holds significant meaning for those who choose to ink it onto their skin. In this blog post, we will explore the history, symbolism, and variations of the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">History of Compass and Anchor Tattoo on the Globe</h2><p>The compass and anchor tattoo on the globe has a rich history that dates back to the maritime era. It was a common tattoo design among sailors, who would often get inked with it as a symbol of their travels and adventures. The compass represents direction, guidance, and exploration, while the anchor represents stability, strength, and grounding. Combining these two symbols with the globe creates a tattoo design that represents a sense of worldly adventure, a desire for exploration, and the need for grounding and stability.</p><p>As maritime culture spread, so did the popularity of the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe. It soon became a common design among non-sailors as well, and today it is one of the most popular tattoo designs across the globe.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Symbolism of Compass and Anchor Tattoo on the Globe</h2><p>The compass and anchor tattoo on the globe holds significant symbolism and meaning for those who choose to get inked with it. The compass represents a sense of direction and guidance, reminding the wearer to stay focused on their goals and aspirations. It also symbolizes a desire for adventure and exploration, encouraging the wearer to step out of their comfort zone and explore new horizons.</p><p>The anchor, on the other hand, represents stability and grounding. It serves as a reminder that no matter how far we may wander, we always have a place to call home. The anchor also represents strength, reminding us that we have the inner strength to weather any storm that comes our way.</p><p>When combined with the globe, the compass and anchor tattoo takes on a new level of meaning. It represents a sense of wanderlust and a desire to explore the world, while also acknowledging the importance of staying grounded and connected to our roots.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-variations-of-compass-and-anchor-tattoo-on-the-globe">Variations of Compass and Anchor Tattoo on the Globe</h2><p>While the basic design of the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe remains the same, there are many variations that allow individuals to personalize their tattoos to suit their individual styles and preferences. Some people opt for a minimalist design, featuring a small compass and an anchor on a simple outline of the globe. Others choose a more elaborate design, incorporating intricate details and shading to create a more realistic representation of the globe.</p><p>The placement of the tattoo can also vary, with some people choosing to ink it on their forearm or wrist for easy visibility, while others opt for a more private placement on their chest or back. The size of the tattoo can also vary, with some people choosing a small, subtle design, while others opt for a larger, more prominent tattoo.</p><p>While tattoos have been around for centuries, the popularity and acceptance of tattoos have grown significantly in recent years. Today, tattoos are not only a form of self-expression but also a way to showcase personal beliefs, experiences, and values. Whether you&#8217;re considering getting a compass and anchor tattoo on the globe or any other tattoo design, it&#8217;s essential to understand the symbolism and meaning behind it.</p><p>Ultimately, a tattoo is a personal choice, and the design you choose should reflect your individuality and values. Tattoos are a lifelong commitment, so it&#8217;s essential to carefully consider the design, placement, and meaning behind your tattoo before getting inked. Whether you choose a simple, minimalist design or an elaborate, intricate tattoo, your ink should be a reflection of who you are and what you stand for.</p><p>In conclusion, the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe is a popular design with significant meaning and symbolism. Its history, culture, and symbolism continue to inspire many individuals to get inked with this design. Whether you&#8217;re a sailor or simply someone who loves to travel and explore the world, the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe is a beautiful way to showcase your love for adventure and groundedness.</p><p>If you&#8217;re interested in getting a compass and anchor tattoo on the globe, it&#8217;s essential to do your research and find a reputable tattoo artist. Look for an artist who specializes in the style of tattoo you&#8217;re interested in and has a portfolio of similar designs. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask questions, discuss your ideas with the artist, and make sure you feel comfortable before getting inked.</p><p>Once you have your tattoo, take proper care of it to ensure it heals properly and lasts a lifetime. Follow your artist&#8217;s aftercare instructions, avoid exposing the tattoo to direct sunlight or chlorine, and keep it moisturized with a gentle, fragrance-free lotion.</p><p>Getting a tattoo is a personal choice, and the meaning behind your tattoo can be as unique and individual as you are. The compass and anchor tattoo on the globe is a beautiful way to showcase your love for adventure, exploration, and groundedness, but it&#8217;s important to choose a design that resonates with you personally. Whether you choose a traditional design or a modern interpretation, your tattoo should be a reflection of who you are and what you stand for.</p><p>In summary, the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe is a popular and meaningful tattoo design with a rich history and symbolism. Whether you&#8217;re a sailor, traveller, or simply someone who loves adventure, this tattoo is a beautiful way to showcase your wanderlust and groundedness.

It&#8217;s one of the oldest symbols known to man. This symbol represents strength, power, and protection.</p><p>A scorpion tattoo represents the traits and attributes of the scorpion. Someone who gets this arachnid tatted on their body might want to send the message that they are deadly, stealthy, and not to be messed with. In addition to representing the scorpion&#8217;s characteristics, this tat could also be a symbol of a variety of other meanings, such as the zodiac sign Scorpio.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">scorpion and rose tattoo</a> represents two living things that are not to be judged by their covers. The scorpion is small, yet intimidating, and the rose is beautiful but can hurt someone with its thorns. Both the scorpion and the rose should be admired from a distance. Getting a tattoo with a scorpion and rose means that you are someone. Who cannot be judged and that people should be wary when trying to get close to you. Either physically or spiritually.

At 2 pm as the boy Bhagat entered the bagh&#8217;s compound he saw blood scattered all over the ground. The turbans and torn clothes of people laid lifeless on the ground. The walls of the compound were red with blood. As it was a curfew in Punjab those days, the blood hadn&#8217;t been cleaned. Bhagat had taken a glass bottle with him before leaving from home. He took a handful of blood-stained soil and put it in the bottle. He reached home and put the bottle on in front of the Sikh gurus portrait and prayed to him for peace and solace for the victims of the massacre and he pledged to teach the British a lesson.</p><p>In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-cooperation movement to encourage a mass protest against the British and to boycott their trade in India, and to end their cooperation with British rule.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The History of the Dove Symbol</strong></p><p>The dove ranks as one of the most widely-known symbols around the world, universally representing peace and love. Due to the symbol‚Äôs wide recognition, these tattoos are popular all around the globe.</p><p><strong>The dove embodies a variety of positive meanings.</strong></p><p><strong>Enduring Love</strong>. Because doves mate with one partner for the duration of their lives and also take care of their young together, they represent steadfast love and devotion. The bond between the mated pair is a lifelong, enduring, and faithful partnership.</p><p><strong>Mythological Significance</strong>. The dove is also mentioned in Greek and Roman mythology: the Greek goddess Aphrodite, the goddess of love and fertility, was said to ride in a chariot borne by doves. Her seven daughters (known as the Pleiades) are referred to as a flock of doves in Greek mythology. Some tribes believed that the spirits of the dead are transformed into doves. Some American Indians may use the dove tattoo to represent this association.</p><p><strong>Dove and Rose Tattoo</strong></p><p><strong>Peace and Harmony.</strong>&nbsp;Since early Christianity, the dove holding an olive branch in its beak has represented a symbol of peace. Ironically, the image of a dove holding a grenade has become quite popular as well.</p><p><strong>Holy Spirit.</strong>&nbsp;The dove is commonly associated with Jesus and Christianity. Many examples of Christian art depict Jesus accompanied by a flock of doves. Doves are mentioned often in the Bible, for example in the story of Noah&#8217;s Ark. Before the great flood, God ordered Noah to build a ark for him and his family and to gather all the animals in pairs, one male and one female. God then flooded the earth and everything was destroyed. After several weeks at sea, Noah sent out a dove and a raven to look for signs of land. When the dove returned with an olive branch in its beak, this was a sign that life would start over.</p><p><strong>The Messenger</strong>. There are many stories about the dove carrying messages, sometimes messages from God, sometimes love letters. The dove is commonly interpreted as a portent of love, victory, peace, or God&#8217;s will.</p><p><strong>Peace and Harmony.</strong>&nbsp;Since early Christianity, the dove holding an olive branch in its beak has represented a symbol of peace. Ironically, the image of a dove holding a grenade has become quite popular as well.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/dove-and-rose-tattoo/">Dove and Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More popularly known in Asian cultures such as in Japan, cherry blossoms have various meanings. They have become a national symbol for the country and they have been known to be celebrating amazing cherry blossom festivals all throughout spring. Not only does the flower have national symbolism it also has cultural impact as well. Primarily it is believed to be a symbol of joy and love; it also helps strengthen the spirit and promotes the beauty of life. Cherry blossoms only bloom in spring and they disappear again after a short time which symbolizes how people should value and appreciate life as it lasts.</p><p>The Japanese cherry blossom is interpreted as &#8216;transient of life&#8217;, since it is very fragile and has a short blooming period. There is an old story attached to this tree that values sacrifice. It is said that there is a&nbsp;<i>Jiu-roku-zakura</i>(the Cherry tree of the Sixteenth day), in the Iyo district of the country. This tree grew on the lands of a Samurai for over a hundred years. When the Samurai became old, the tree began to die. The Samurai felt really bad for the tree. He was a brave and honorable man. Hence, he thought up of a way to save the tree&#8217;s life.</p><p>He sat under the tree and committed a ritual suicide right there. This act gave the essence of the Samurai&#8217;s life to the tree. Within one hour of the Samurai&#8217;s death, on the 16th day of the month. The tree began to blossom and continues to live even today. Hence, the cherry blossom tree harbors many spiritual beliefs. These beliefs are set deep within the fundamental teachings of the Buddha.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/cherry-blossom-flower-tattoo/">Cherry Blossom Flower Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The compass tattoo has been a popular choice among a majority of cultures for centuries. This maritime symbol was popular among early sailors. Getting a compass tattoo would protect them. On rough waters and ensure that you would return home safely.</p><p>One of the main reasons sailors opted for this tattoo was that of protection. As a token of good luck, images of compasses painted on the ships as well. The seas were rough and unforgiving. Often times ships and the men onboard would disappear without a trace so these images served as a beacon of hope that they would be guided out of the treacherous waters alive.</p><p>Compass tattoos can come in a variety of styles and variations. These include,&nbsp;star compass, astrocompass, lodestone compass, Vegvisir compass and prismatic compass.</p><p><strong>The star compass is the most popular of the aforementioned designs and is said to represent the North Star.</strong></p><p>Before maps and technology existed, humans used the North Star to guide them in the right direction. Because of this, this style of tattoo stands for guidance, direction and finding a way home.</p><p>A way of depicting this is to include an image of a clock or hourglass with the compass in the tattoo design. Maps and earth play a role as well as maps, like compasses, help a user determine their location.</p><p>Compass tattoos have also represented the ideal of following one‚Äôs dreams. It is symbolic of staying your course in life and to not give up no matter how rough things may seem.</p><p>The compass will guide you where you need to be.</p><p>Overall, this type of tattoo conveys guidance and direction, but you may add additional design elements to your tattoo to have it depict a meaning that is significant to you.</p><p>#compasstattoo #ClockAndCompassTattoo #Compass #tattoo #tattoos #girlswithtattoos #tattooed #tattooartist #tattooart #tattooedgirls #guyswithtattoos #instatattoo #tattoolife #tattoodesign #traditionaltattoo #tattooflash #tattooist #tattoogirl #handtattoo #tattooedgirl #sleevetattoo #tattooing #tattooshop #blacktattoo #chesttattoo #tattoosofinstagram #rosetattoo #blackandgreytattoo #tattoomodel #tattooer #colortattoo</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/anchor-compass-tattoo/">Anchor Compass Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A roaring lion is an animal to be respected and feared. It is a symbol of Power and Authority and a sign that you aren&#8217;t a person to be taken lightly. Roaring lions are born leaders, gifted fighters, and, in a crunch, are the persons who can best guide the group out of danger.&nbsp;<span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s1">t</span><span class="s1">he tradition</span>, a lion whelp was still-born but brought to life by the roar of his father. The whelp later went on to create and lead the tribes of Israel. The symbolism shows that the word of the Divine (represented by the roaring Lion) has the power to breathe life into weakest being (the whelp) and transform him into a force to be reckoned with. A Roaring Lion Tattoo expresses to the world that you aren&#8217;t a pushover and that a beast lies underneath the surface, primed and ready to strike.</p><p>Aside from the basic verbal symbolism of the lion, there are some deeper meanings connected to them as well.</p><p>Lion tattoos have been placed on men throughout history. Those in Asia, Africa, India and the Middle East have put great emphasis on the lion tattoo for many centuries. Lions have always known as the king of the jungle and this status portrays great power. I think this has always been the big draw about the lion tattoo. If you think about it, the lion can also be a symbol of a religious nature. King of the Jungle ‚Äì King of Kings.</p><p><b>Ancient Civilizations</b></p><p>The lion has been portrayed for many years in ancient cultures, legends, mythology, astrology, literature, movies, and much more. In a few ancient civilizations, lions were owned by kings and royalty. The lion was a symbol of power to the people of the king&#8217;s&nbsp;power&nbsp;and&nbsp;strength. In an interesting contrast, in Roman mythology, the lion is associated with&nbsp;love.</p><p>The lion was also symbolic to the Egyptians they often portrayed two lions with their backs to one another. These statues represented&nbsp;balance, which was very important to the Egyptians. They would usually place these statues outside of sacred structures. The Egyptians believed in balance, such as sunrise sunset and east-west their lion statues represented this all-important balance.</p><p><strong>Religion</strong></p><p>The lion is also a symbol of Christianity. Some Christians use the lion tattoo to symbolize Christian beliefs. The lion is also a symbolic figure to Islam, in which the lion and the sword represent power. The lion is also a solar animal. This means that the lion has sun-like qualities and characteristics. In many culture and beliefs, the lion is associated with the sun. It is said that the the lion&#8217;s mane looks like the rays of the sun‚Äîa trait that many tattoos often highlight. In other ancient myths, the lion represents the&nbsp;transformation&nbsp;and journey from childhood to adulthood.</p><p><strong>Culture</strong></p><p>The lion is also very symbolic to the Chinese. It represents a symbol of good luck,&nbsp;guardianship, and power. The Chinese also believe that the lion is a symbol of the earth and sun. Many people know that the lion &#8220;Leo&#8221; is part of the Zodiac. Leo is the 5th sign of the Zodiac, and anyone born between July 23-August 22 is considered to be a Leo. People born during this time are very highly energetic and are good hearted people. The Leo is somewhat timid and enjoys control, but they are very generous. The Leo also represents balance.</p><p>As you now know, the lion has been portrayed throughout human history and they have been symbolic figures for many years. It is one of the most symbolic animal tattoos that are available. Due to all the different meanings it holds, it is highly sought after in the tattoo world. There are also a variety of different designs and styles for it as well. There are tribal designs and Celtic designs, and many more. Before choosing a final design, make sure you check out every style and design that is available. Make sure you choose a design that you are satisfied with.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lion-tattoos-on-arm-2/">Lion Tattoos on Arm</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hourglass Tattoo History</strong></p><p>Invented in Alexandria somewhere around 150 B.C., the hourglass plays an important part in the life of history. Used to measure time accurately and repeatedly, hourglasses saved the lives of many before someone invented the modern clock.</p><p><span class="keyword"><strong>Hourglass Tattoo Sleeve</strong></span></p><p>While primitive, their small measurements helped synchronize groups of people. Few alternatives match the abilities of the hourglass.</p><p><strong>Hourglass Tattoo Sleeve</strong></p><p>When the&nbsp;hourglass‚Äôs popularity spread from Egypt into northern countries, the strange depiction of time captured the hearts of artists and philosophers. It was the only symbol that could depict both the past and the present at the same time, so it came to represent both life and death. Its sands would flow regardless of the elements around it‚Äîjust as a person‚Äôs life winds down at a steady pace, regardless of their good or bad deeds‚Äîso it was also used to instill a fear of death into people. Pirates adopted it for their flags, and people still place it on gravestones and coffins.</p><p>The hourglass proved most useful in nautical navigation. Mariners from Alexandria used the hourglass to measure minutes out at sea. While sailing the ocean, the constant change in wave height and angle of the sun disoriented sailors and that lead them to lose their sense of time. Hourglasses mitigated that to an extent and made sailing a much more accurate ordeal. Sailors used it to time their voyages and memorize the exact times between ports and landmarks. For those that watched the deck at night, they could compare it to the stars above. With the help of the ever-changing constellations, they navigated with accuracy.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/hourglass-tattoo-sleeve/">Hourglass Tattoo Sleeve</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us have owned or seen diamonds at some point. When we think about them, we often think about wealth, luxury and fashion, even the higher quality of one&#8217;s life. Some people wear diamonds on their ring fingers while others wear them on their skin, having a micro dermally implanted diamond. Diamonds have decorated all types of ancient and royal crowns and are called a &#8220;<i>girl&#8217;s best friend.</i>&#8220;</p><p><b>History:</b>&nbsp;The word &#8220;diamond&#8221; is Greek in origin (<span class="s1">·ºÄ</span>Œ¥Œ¨ŒºŒ±œÇ‚Äì<i>ad√°mas</i>&nbsp;or &#8220;unbreakable&#8221;) and means strength and invincibility. They are made of a nearly indestructible mineral, created deep in the earth by massive pressure weighing down on carbon deposits and then brought up to the earth&#8217;s surface via volcanic eruptions. One of the earliest recorded accounts of diamonds was from India around 400 BC. Today, most come from Africa.</p><p><b>Beauty:</b>&nbsp;You&#8217;ll find diamonds in fashion magazines and on any red carpet or runway. There are sayings that equate these gems with inner beauty (like a &#8220;diamond in the rough&#8221;). which is apt, since they appear rough on the outside when first mined, but once they are polished, their beauty is revealed. To the tattoo wearer, the diamond may represent inner beauty, as in the saying, &#8220;true beauty is found on the inside.&#8221;</p><p><b>Power:</b>&nbsp;We often associate diamonds with wealth and the power that money can bring. The gem is very expensive and multiple diamonds may represent great wealth and value. They are extremely coveted items and some people will do anything to get their hands on them.</p><p><b>Words about Diamonds:</b>&nbsp;As I stated earlier, some tattoos incorporate famous quotes or personal words to underline and accentuate the meaning of the tattoo. These quotes may be placed on ribbons or&nbsp;<span class="s2">banners</span>&nbsp;or inked inside or outside the diamond design. Another popular thing that people do is have the first letter of their own name. The name of a loved one inked inside the diamond.</p><p><b>Diamond as a Birthstone:</b>&nbsp;People born in April claim the diamond as their birthstone. A tattoo may be used to represent the month a person was born. Since diamonds are associated with the month of April. The gem might be used as a symbolic representation of anything or anyone that began that month.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/diamond-wings-tattoo/">Diamond Wings Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra Tattoo with Ohm</strong></p><p>Crescent: Shiva bears on his head the crescent of the Panchami (fifth day) moon. This is placed near the fiery third eye and this shows the power of Soma, the sacrificial offering, which is the representative of the moon. It means that Shiva possesses the power of procreation along with the power of destruction. The moon is also a measure of time, thus Crescent also represents his control over time.</p><p>The Cobra Necklace: This suggests that Shiva is beyond the powers of death and is often the sole support in case of distress. He swallowed the poison kalketu for the wellbeing of the Universe. The deadly cobra represents the death aspect that Shiva has thoroughly conquered. The cobras around his neck also represent the dormant energy, called Kundalini, the serpent power. The snake curled three times around the neck of Lord Shiva depicts the past, present, and future times. The snake looking in the right direction of Lord Shiva signifies that the Lord‚Ä≤s perpetual laws of reason and justice preserve natural order in the universe.</p><p>The Vibhuti: Vibhuti is a three-line of ashes drawn on the forehead that signifies the Immortality of the soul and manifested glory of the Lord.</p><p>Tiger Skin: Lord Shiva is shown sitting on or wearing a tiger skin. The tiger is the vehicle of Shakti, the Goddess of power and force. Shiva is beyond and above any kind of force. He is the master of Shakti. The tiger skin that he wears symbolizes victory over every force. Tigers also represent lust. Thus sitting on Tiger skin, Shiva indicates that he has conquered lust.</p><p>The Elephant &amp; Deer Skin: Shiva also wears elephant skins. Elephants represent pride. Wearing elephant skin, Shiva indicates that he has conquered pride. Similarly, deer represent the flickering mind. Shiva wears deer skin which indicates that he has controlled the mind perfectly.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong>&nbsp;#LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/maha-mrityunjaya-mantra-tattoo-with-om-on-back/">Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra Tattoo with Om on Back</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>3D Star Tattoo with Nice Words Inked by Black Poison Tattoos</p><p>Some nice words like friendship, freedom, family, love, and more are inserted into a large 3D star Tattoo.</p><p>Star tattoos can be nice and unique delegate of your inner personality and conviction. Star tattoo designs look cool and they are a good preference for a very first ink piece because a star is typically small in design and doesn‚Äôt need to be awfully intricate. These designs look attractive and generally they signify a change in life.</p><p>The star is one of the oldest classical cryptograms and it has been an important image in many cultures and religions. When human knew nothing about them, what actually they are, still they were very lovable by human. In the ancient times, human stared up at the sky and attempted to explain that superlative view with the help of myths and religion.</p><p>They are universal cryptograms, not attached to an exact religion or culture, and actually can mean plenty of unique things to plenty of unique people. Male and females have separate star tattoos designs prearranged for them. Females love the shooting stars since they look very feminine, whereas guys love the nautical stars since they look manly. Star tattoos can be drawn as a single star, solitary star, or as an assemblage of small stars, celestial, or nautical designs.</p><p>Star tattoos designs are very flexible and can mesh up with wings, skulls, moon &amp; sun, scroll, flowers, butterfly, fairy and we think almost every kind of image or symbol can be mesh up with stars with the aim of generating a unique and personal tattoo. If you are looking for unique star tattoos not those common or creepy designs.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/3d-star-tattoo/">3D Star Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
