										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A flower tattoo is a popular choice for women and men alike. Flowers are not only beautiful but also versatile. You can use flowers in a variety of ways to convey different meanings. The design of the flower is also important, so it&#8217;s best to choose one that you think suits your personality. Here is a collection of some colorful flower tattoos with letters:</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-flower-tattoo">Flower Tattoo</h4><p>Flower tattoos can be inked in any color you choose, or they can be done in black and white to give them an elegant look. Many different types of flowers can be used to create a great flower tattoo design. You can choose from roses, Lillies, sunflowers, or even daisies depending on the type of flower you have decided upon for your tattoo.</p><p>Flower tattoos are beautiful to look at and offer different meanings depending on what kind of flower is chosen for your tattoo design!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-flower-tattoo-design">Flower Tattoo Design</h4><p>Flower tattoos are a popular choice for women.</p><p>These tattoos can be designed in many ways and colors, styles, and sizes.</p><p>The most popular placement for women’s tattoos is on the arms, lower back, and legs. They are also placed in other areas such as the chest, stomach, and neck.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-colorful-flower-tattoo">Colorful Flower Tattoo</h4><p>A colorful flower tattoo is a popular choice for women. It&#8217;s feminine, vibrant, and fun. They&#8217;re also easier to hide or conceal than other types of tattoos.</p><p>A colorful flower tattoo is always an excellent choice!</p><p>Flower tattoos can be placed on any part of the body. They are very versatile and can be used as an accent tattoo, a full sleeve tattoo, or even just a simple single flower placed in an unusual place.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-watercolor-flower-tattoo">Watercolor Flower Tattoo</h4><p>The watercolor flower tattoo is a great piece to show off your love of the arts. Watercolor flower tattoos have been around for quite some time and they are still as popular as ever. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to express yourself, this is one of the best ways to do so!</p><p>Watercolor artwork can be done in many different ways:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Outline &#8211; A solid outline without any shading or highlighting will create an image that appears flat on your skin. This style can be used on its own or combined with other styles such as dotwork or linework for extra detail and dimensionality.</li><li>Dotwork &#8211; Similar in appearance to block color tattoos, but instead of using blocks of solid color, dots create patterns within each flower shape that create depth and shading effects just like paint would appear while being applied to the paper surface; this adds more dimensionality than simply outlining everything would provide alone since it separates each individual petal with its own layer instead just drawing one single line around them all together making them seem less connected together than they are.</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-light-purple-iris-flower-tattoo">Light Purple Iris Flower Tattoo</h4><p>Flower tattoos are one of the most popular types of tattoo designs, and there are many reasons why they’re so popular. For one thing, flowers can be used as symbols or reminders of important life events and milestones. For example, if you got married on a certain day or your first child was born on a certain day, you might want to commemorate those dates with flowers in your tattoo design.</p><p>If you have someone in mind when considering getting a flower tattoo (like an ex-partner), it’s important to make sure that person is someone who meant something special to you before getting a flower tattoo. If not, then it may feel like they were just another person in your life that didn’t mean anything special at all!</p><p>Flowers also represent beauty and happiness which makes them perfect for any girl looking for ways she can boost her self-esteem after having been through some tough times lately.&#8221;</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dark-purple-iris-flower-tattoo">Dark Purple Iris Flower Tattoo</h4><p>You can make a dark purple iris flower tattoo by using a thin brush and black ink. This is one of the most popular flowers for tattoos because its meaning is so deep. The iris flower symbolizes feelings of love, compassion, and respect. It&#8217;s also associated with faithfulness, loyalty, and honor to your family members.</p><p>Of course, there are several types of this particular flower that you can use as inspiration for your own tattoo design:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Purple Iris Tattoo Designs: This type has leaves that resemble the shape of maple leaves but have purple petals instead of green ones. A great example would be Victor Cruz&#8217;s arm tattoo! He got it done right underneath his sleeve; this allows him to cover it when he puts on his jersey during games without having to worry about hiding anything important in there like his number 97 (which also happens to be his favorite number).</li><li>Blue Iris Tattoo Designs: Another variation of this design will use only blue instead &#8211; usually lighter shades though not always true; some artists prefer darker hues such as midnight sky tones or even navy blue color schemes which might seem strange since they&#8217;re not what we typically expect from something called &#8220;blue iris.&#8221; However, if done correctly then these designs would look stunning especially if paired with other types such as yellow roses or red tulips (or both!)!!!</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-flower-tattoo-is-a-popular-tattoo-choice-for-women">A flower tattoo is a popular tattoo choice for women.</h4><p>A flower tattoo is a popular tattoo choice for women. A flower tattoo is also a popular choice for men and couples, who like to get matching flower tattoos. This particular flower tattoo has an interesting element of lettering on the left of it, and it makes this design pop!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>We hope you enjoyed this watercolor flower tattoo and its meaning. If you&#8217;re interested in getting one yourself, make sure to choose the right design based on your personality and interests! Remember: flowers are symbols of beauty, hope, love, and other positive things that can help you express yourself through body art.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/watercolor-flower-tattoo/">Watercolor Flower Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Tattoos are extremely personal, and while they might seem modern, cool, and trendy, they mean much more than a shape or symbol. <span class="m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg">Most of us worship Lord Shiva without understanding the deep meaning him. Shiva is ‘Shakti’ or power. </span></p><p><strong>Om with Trishul armband, Shiva Tattoos, shiva tattoo, religious tattoo, custom tattoo, religious armband, armband, third eye tattoo, shiva tattoo design, Om Tattoo</strong></p><p><span class="m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg">Lord Shiva is also considered to be the most unique of all Hindu gods and also the God of all. Shiva is often shown with many faces, as creator, destroyer and preserver in total command of the cosmos. He contains both good and evil. The main iconographical attributes of Shiva are the third eye on his forehead, the snake Vasuki around his neck, the crescent moon adorning, the holy river Ganga flowing from his matted hair, the Trishula as his weapon and the Damru as his musical instrument.He blesses his followers with grace, knowledge and peace.<span class="m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526Apple-converted-space m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/"><strong>Om with Trishul</strong></a></p><p><span class="m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg">As discuss above, that Shiva is the supreme Power among all gods. So shiva is the most favored and is the god of yogis too. So there are millions of people who worship lord shiva very truly. People want a design to reflect their spiritual beliefs, so people look out for shiva tattoo designs and symbols like Om and Trishula with the third eye.</span></p><p><span class="m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg">In different Eastern religion scriptures the Om, Trishula and third eye is a symbol of rich and deep meaning. That extends into the universe. The Om holds secrets far older than written texts. This symbol is used in chanting spiritual texts, &amp; has been a part of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain meditative practices for centuries.</span></p><p><span class="m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg"> Trishula has come to symbolize several important &#8216;triads&#8217;. First, there is the Hindu trinity of deities &#8211; Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. It also stands for the aspects and powers associated with these gods &#8212; Creation, Preservation, and Destruction.<span class="m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526Apple-converted-space m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span class="m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg">Take a look at these designs and tattoos and get your </span><span class="m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s2 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg">Shiva </span><span class="m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg">inspiration from here.</span></p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/om-with-trishul-tattoo/">Om With Trishul Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are looking for a Sister Tattoo that you can share with your sister, then we have some amazing styles that you can choose from. Getting any type of ink is a big commitment, especially if you are getting it with someone. Getting a <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">tattoo</a> with someone else is serious business, so you want to make sure that you both love it. Sisters always have a strong bond and a tattoo can be a symbol of that bond. A sister’s bond is unbreakable, you know that and you want to share that. A sister can be so much more than a family member. A sister can be your best friend, a confidant, and your one true soul mate.</p><p>By getting a tattoo with your sister, you can strengthen the bond of friendship and love so much more. It’s a great way to show your love. There is a lot of meaning in matching tattoos. If you want to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><span class="s1">symbolize your </span></a><span class="s1">sisterhood</span>, then try out a matching tattoo design. It will be a fun way for the both of you to connect together. It will be something special that will draw you closer together. Get a tattoo that both of you will enjoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p>Wrists are quite commonplace to get a tattoo. Choosing a cute wrist tattoo will show your love and your connection with your sister.&nbsp; It can be a small tattoo or a good size tattoo like the photo above.&nbsp; This is sweet, cute, and innocent, showing two girls on swings that are sisters. &nbsp;As you can see in the photo, the two tattoos are the opposite of each other.&nbsp; Of course, when you get together, you have to take a photo like the one above to show off your matching tattoos!</p><p>Sisters may drive you crazy, get into your stuff and irritate you. However, if anyone else dares say so, a sister will defend you to the death.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/sister-tattoo/">Matching Sister Tattoos</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Infinity tattoos are steadily on the rise with many people opting to get these in one form or another.</strong></p><p>The infinity symbol, often used in mathematics, represents a never-ending loop and is depicted as a number 8 on its side. In the tattoo world, this can be seen as a symbol of never-ending or limitless possibility. Some cultures also believe it to represent rebirth or reincarnation.</p><p>Historically, this symbol is similar to mythological creatures such as Ouroboros; the snake which consumed its tail and became a creature without end. Often when people get their infinity tattoo, for this reason, they are showing that they are both into mythology and that they like the creatures that the symbol represents. These aren’t the deepest meanings for the infinity tattoo, but they can always attach more meanings to the design later on.</p><p><strong>The endless loops and circles that comprise the infinity symbol can also be likened to the seasonal cycle which endlessly repeats year after year.</strong></p><p>In this way, the infinity tattoo could mean that the person wants to keep their eye on the ball no matter what time of year it is. It could also mean that they don’t necessarily have a favorite season. But instead choose to enjoy their lives regardless of the time of year it currently is.</p><p>These infinity tattoos, while simple, can be customized in a variety of ways.</p><p>Popular choices for this type of tattoo include a word or phrase. Inside the loop, such as “love”, “life” or “friendship”.</p><p>These, of course, signify a relationship that will never end. And are often used as matching tattoos for two or more people.</p><p>One can even add additional symbols such a hearts, stars or other embellishments. To add to the flair of the design.</p><p>The fact is that the infinity symbol itself is a bit bland unless holds a lot of meaning to you.</p><p>so many people decide to surround it with other images that make the meaning come to life a bit more.</p><p>As always, it comes down to the tastes of the person getting the infinity tattoo.</p><p>If they are able to find a design that works well with the infinity symbol.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/infinity-tattoo/">Infinity Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone rightly said once that God could not be anywhere and that is why he created mothers. Mothers are truly special and one can never do enough to show them just how much they are loved and appreciated. But there are some ways through which one can tell their mom just much she is loved.</p><p>Nothing speaks better than a permanent tattoo. Tattoos are like preserving and expressing love for as long as you are alive. Mothers and special and so they deserve a special place in your life and what better way than to keep her with you forever on a part of you. It is nothing but a sign of truly unbreakable bond. Maa Tattoos are very popular among <a href="http://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/minimalist-tattoo-ideas-designs-that-prove-subtle-things-can-be-the-most-beautiful-2/">small tattoos</a> for girls.</p><p><strong>Mother Tattoo</strong></p><p>Mothers expect nothing but unconditional love and support from her children and what better way to show her that with a simple but beautiful tattoo. Some mothers definitely do not want to see their children going through pain and getting a permanent tattoo is a little painful but if she sees that you went through that pain just because you love her, she would surely grow bigger with love.</p><p>Tattoos don’t require words as they are a language on their own.</p><p>Today mother and daughter even get matching tattoos which are not only adorable but make other mother-daughter pairs envious. Sharing a common tattoo is a lot more personal and deep than just doing something together.</p><p>Mothers daughters and grandmothers nowadays have matching tattoos and this concept of generation tattoos is beautiful. Tattoos don’t have to be large and colorful to convey feelings. Even a small, sweet tattoo is enough to show love and gratitude.</p><p>You can get a tattoo for your mom or with your mom to establish bond just as deep as blood bond. In case of mom tattoos or mother daughter tattoos, less is definitely more. No one else deserves a place on your body more than your mother because she kept you in her womb for nine months.</p><p>She nurtured you and cared for you not because she had any selfish interests but because she loves you with all her heart.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/maa-tattoo-2/">Maa Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peony symbolizes wealth, good fortune, and prosperity. Peony is a strong symbol of beauty, fragility and transitory nature of existence. Furthermore, they depict that getting great rewards is only possible by taking great risks.</p><p>When you combine the beauty of a&nbsp;flower with the edginess of a wrist tattoo you have a winning combination for a feminine and unique design. Flower tattoos remain a popular choice for many reasons.</p><p>Adding to their obvious beauty is the individual meanings of the flowers. Some flowers represent love and friendship, while others have associations of new life and peace. While their personal significance may remain a secret, their beauty can be shared with others. Whether you adore a certain blossom for its true beauty or appreciate the sentiment behind it, the following wrist tattoo ideas are perfect for brainstorming your first or next petaled tattoo.</p><p>The pairing is known as Karajishi and the lion’s ferocity is tempered by the peony’s beauty.</p><p><strong>Peony Tattoo</strong></p><p>Peony is a flower with a deep history of veneration and cultivation for many centuries. For example in China and Japan, the peony is a symbolic floral with similar meaning to the lotus, chrysanthemum and cherry blossom.</p><p>Peony is a symbol of wealth. Also remember that in China and Japan people used stone lions to guard sacred places, homes, Palaces, and temples and therefore the peony and the lion combination are not accidental.</p><p>Peony can be placed as a tattoo design in various way. They may portray the peony flower alone or combined with other elements and symbols. Peony was&nbsp;deep red in color as a tattoo design. Over time, the tattoo designs changed to include peonies in shades of orange, white, yellow and pink.</p><p>Furthermore, Peony flower tattoos may portray purple and blue color. As a result, you should be able to select the color that you want.</p><p>If you are more into color symbolism, you should be able to select a color that will represent you.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/flower-wrist-band-peony-tattoo/">Flower Wrist Band Peony Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This belief in reincarnation leads us to our next Hindu term &#8211; karma. Lucky for us, this one is bit more familiar. In very simplified terms, <b>karma</b> is the Hindu belief that a person&#8217;s actions in life will determine their fate in the next life. If a person is kind and selfless in this life, they&#8217;ll be rewarded in the next. Unfortunately, the opposite is also true. If a person is a scoundrel today, let&#8217;s just say they&#8217;ll be paying for it in their next tomorrow! Although our culture doesn&#8217;t always use the word karma. Vestiges of it are apparent in phrases like. &#8216;What goes around comes around,&#8217; or &#8216;He sure got what was coming to &#8217;em!&#8217;</p><p><strong>Sanskrit Tattoo</strong></p><p>To understand <b>moksha</b>, which means &#8216;liberation,&#8217; one must first understand several other important ideas in Hinduism &#8211; particularly, <b>samsara</b>. Samsara is a Sanskrit word. That refers to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, to the passing of the soul from one life to another. As the soul transitions between these lives, the next incarnation is informed by the deeds of the previous life. This is the Hindu belief of the concept of <b>karma</b>. You may have heard people talk about karma and the idea that people&#8217;s choices will come back to affect them one way or another in the future. The Hindu concept of karma is similar to the popular use, but a person&#8217;s responsibility for her/his actions. good or bad, is dealt with in the next life, not the current one.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/sanskrit-tattoo/">Karma and Moksha</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The om / ohm word has a very rich and deep meaning. The text om / ohm itself looks very graceful with the flowing lines. These line curve upward and downward that resembles the start and end of life and death. This is very a beautiful symbol that expresses the source of life. In many eastern religion manuscripts the om is a symbol for the whole universe. This is followed by Hindu, Buddhist, and jain form many centuries.</p><p>This has inspired by the many tattoo artists, due to its wide meanings and the beautiful symbol. The syllable of this word is the first sound of life that is used in variations by a many tattoo artist. This is also combined many a times with traditional Indian symbols to make beautiful tattoo designs. It is combined with the lotus that reflects deep consciousness and beauty. You may see this with the ganesha’s head made in rounded form and the arches. Some tattoo designs also have some Sanskrit chants written in a circular design to show the eternal circle of life. They can be done in black ink or many-colored patterns as per your requirement.</p><p>#ohmtattoo #ohm #tattoo #religioustattoo #ohmtattoos #tattoos #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #anchortattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #letteringtattoo #liontattoo #skulltattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/ohm-tattoo/">Ohm Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feather tattoos are equally important among men and women, because their symbolic meaning make them relevant for both the sexes. Feathers have commonly been used as tattoo designs since distant past and they have a deep rooted, significant meaning associated with them, when used as tattoos, both among men and women. These designs continue to be popular and sought after ones till date, between both the sexes. Feathers have always been the object of fascination for human beings, as they are associated with birds, the exquisite flying creatures which stand for freedom, independence, triumph and liberty and these tattoos, which incorporate beautiful feather design, symbolize the power of birds. In fact, feathers can not only add an amazing beauty to a tattoo design, but also give it an absolutely new meaning and significance for the bearer.</p><p><strong>The Symbolic Meaning of Feather Tattoos</strong></p><p>They are all about giving freedom to the individuality of a person and establishing him as an individual in his own right. In Native American culture, feathers were used as a protective talisman, which is the reason why these made an integral part of dreamcatchers, as a hanging on the bottom part, as they were considered effective for trapping bad dreams and negative energies, and providing protection from nightmares. The culture also regarded the feathers as a symbol of nature and revered them for the same reason.</p><p><strong>Cultural Significance of Feather Tattoos</strong></p><p>In Native American cultures, feathers represented the spirit of the birds they belonged to and these feathers were used by them in their ritualistic ceremonies, for the purpose of purifying and energizing the environment with their positive spiritual energies. Feathers of different birds had their own different meanings. For instance, eagle feathers were presented to warriors as they stood for bravery and courage, besides having the ability to help the recipient soar high in life, in worldly as well as spiritual sense. This is the reason these tattoos were seen mostly on the bodies of military forces. At the same time, these feathers were of tremendous spiritual value in Native American culture, as they represented wisdom and spiritual communication.</p><p>In some cultures, a fallen feather depicts a departed soul, while others take it as a sign of birth. It is also said that feathers stand for the communication of a person with the departed souls as they convey the messages from the spirit world. Christianity has said about the feathers being related to great virtues and an image of a signet ring bearing three feathers was a symbolic of charity, faith and hope, with each of the three feathers representing one of these virtues. In ancient Egypt, feathers were used in worshipping the Gods and a feather tattoo stood for the wisdom of the Egyptian Goddess Matt, the Goddess of truth and justice. It was believed that she compared the weight of the heart of the deceased with that of a feather, while carrying out the mummification process. If the heart was as light as the feather, the soul was deemed as pure and the spirit was considered fit for further evolution and could move freely into the next phase of afterlife. According to Celtic mythology, the people with superior powers wore cloaks adorned with feathers for some special ceremonies. In the legend, Morrigon wore a cloak of raven feathers to get transformed into a bird, which gave her a power of higher reasoning to understand the world in a better way. As like feather tattoos Koi fish tattoos has its own cultural significance and historical background.</p><p>Besides the designs of feathers and the birds they come from, the color of the feathers have their symbolic meanings too. For instance, white stands for purity, yellow for smartness and red for passion. Just like feathers are associated with spiritual heights, liberty and freedom, feather tattoos are all about dreams, higher intelligence and spiritual uplifting. They stand for movement of soul and ability to float despite all kinds of obstacles.</p><p><strong>Feather Tattoo Designs</strong></p><p>As different birds have different types of feathers, there is an equally vast variety available in terms of tattoo designs for people to pick from. But this must be done after proper research about the deeper meaning to be signified by the feather tattoo. Besides the regular designing of the feather tattoo, some modifications can go a long way in enhancing its beauty and overall look. There have been examples of use of vivid colors and adornments such as beads to make these tattoos even more impressive.</p><p>Feather tattoos are equally important among men and women, because their symbolic meaning make them relevant for both the sexes. While men love to have them adorned because they mean power, freedom and strength, they look great on women too. When it comes to the exact placement of feather tattoos on the body, there are a number of options where these tattoos can look good. They can be adorned on back, side, chest, arm and foot.</p><p>#featherinfinitytattoo #feathertattoo #peacockfeathertattoo #infinitytattoo #infinity #tattoo #tattoos #designs #art #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #anchortattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #letteringtattoo #liontattoo #skulltattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/feather-infinity-tattoo/">Feather Infinity Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazing Maze Tattoo with Quotes &#8211; The Way Out is Through Inked By Black Poison Tattoos</p><p>The terms of maze and labyrinth are describing the same thing: a puzzle game, either on paper or life size, where you have to make your way without getting lost. There is only one way possible in a labyrinth, while there are many possibilities in a maze, as well as many entry and exit points. That’s why mazes are much more difficult than labyrinths, and maze tattoos more coveted than labyrinth ones.</p><p>But they both find their origin in Ancient Greek mythology. The wife of King Minos had a monstruous illegitimate son with a magic bull. This son, called the Minotaur, was a dangerous man-eater, and to protect his city, King Minos asked the most brilliant architect of Greece, Daedalus, to build a prison. He built the Labyrinth with his son Icarus. The legend says that the maze was so complex they both got lost, and to escape it, Daedalus made them wings to fly away. But the tragic end of Icarus is infamous: he flew too close to the sun and died.</p><p>Later, the Minotaur’s Labyrinth was also the famous location of another legend: the one of Theseus and Ariadne. Young people of Theseus’ city were captured to feed the monster, so the young heroe decided to kill it. But he had to exit the mind-boggling maze after. So Minos’ daughter, Ariadne, who was in love with him, gave him a red thread to find his way back. This famous red thread became a common expression in language. Labyrinths and mazes in general have very philosophical and sacred meanings. They describe our evolution in life, the choices we make, the different paths we follow and the possibilities we reach or miss.</p><p>If you like challenges and if you are looking for your way in that life, you should consider getting maze tattoos, but you’re warned: don’t get lost!</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/maze-tattoo-with-quotes/">Maze Tattoo with Quotes</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

One design that has consistently captured the imagination of tattoo enthusiasts is the 3D skull, 3rd eye with rose tattoo. This powerful combination transcends mere aesthetics, weaving together themes of mortality, enlightenment, and enduring beauty.</p><p><strong>Delving into the Symbolism:</strong></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>The 3D Skull:</strong> Skulls have been used as symbolic imagery for centuries. While often associated with death and mortality, they can also represent transformation, rebirth, and a reminder to live life to the fullest. The 3D effect adds a layer of realism, emphasizing the impermanence of our physical form.</li>

<li><strong>The Third Eye:</strong> In many spiritual traditions, the third eye represents intuition, hidden knowledge, and a connection to a higher plane of existence. Here, it acts as a counterpoint to the skull, signifying the enduring spirit and potential for deeper understanding beyond the physical realm.</li>

<li><strong>The Rose:</strong> Roses are universally recognized symbols of love, beauty, and passion. Their inclusion in this tattoo design adds a touch of softness and reminds us that even in the face of mortality, beauty and love persist.</li></ul><p><strong>Beyond the Symbolism:</strong></p><p>The 3D skull, 3rd eye with rose tattoo is not just about its symbolic meaning. The 3D style allows for a visually striking design, with realistic shading and depth that creates a captivating piece of art on the skin. The placement of this tattoo can also hold personal significance. A larger design might be suited for the back or arm, while a smaller version could grace the wrist or ankle.</p><p><strong>Who is This Tattoo For?</strong></p><p>This tattoo is ideal for individuals who are drawn to spiritual symbolism and a desire to explore the deeper aspects of life and death. It&#8217;s also a great choice for those who appreciate bold and visually stunning artwork.</p><p><strong>Considering Getting This Tattoo?</strong></p><p>If you&#8217;re considering getting a 3D skull, 3rd eye with rose tattoo, it&#8217;s important to find a skilled tattoo artist who can create a design that reflects your personal vision. Discuss your ideas with the artist and ensure they have experience with 3D tattooing.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/3d-skull-with-rose-tattoo/">Unveiling the Mystery of the 3D Skull, 3rd Eye with Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
