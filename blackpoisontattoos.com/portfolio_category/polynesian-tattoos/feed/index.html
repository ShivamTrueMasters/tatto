There are some words, which are basically the same throughout all Polynesian languages, reflecting the deepest core of all Polynesian cultures. Moana (ocean) and mana (spiritual force and energy) are two terms that transcend all Polynesian cultures.</p><p>Moana (ocean) and mana (spiritual force and energy) are two terms that transcend all Polynesian cultures.</p><p><strong>The Origins of Tattoo Art in Polynesia</strong></p><p>Historically there was no writing in the Polynesian culture so the Polynesian’s used tattoo art that was full of distinctive signs to express their identity and personality. Tattoos would indicate status in a hierarchical society as well as sexual maturity, genealogy and ones rank within the society.</p><p>However, the European navigators showed little interest due to the lack of valuable resources.</p><p>Captain James Cook (as mentioned in our comprehensive guide to Maori tattooing) was the first navigator trying to explore the aforementioned Polynesian triangle.</p><p>In 1771, when James Cook first returned to Tahiti and New Zealand from his first voyage, the word “tattoo” appeared in Europe.</p><p>He narrated the behaviors of the Polynesian people in his voyage, which he called tattaw. He also brought a Tahitian named Ma’i to Europe. Since then tattoo started to become rapidly famous, predominantly because of the tattoos of Ma’i.</p><p>Another legend is that European sailors liked the Polynesian tattoos. So much that they spread extremely fast in Europe because the sailors emblazoned the tattoos on their own bodies.</p><p>The actual tradition of Polynesian tattooing existed more than 2000 years ago. However, in the 18th century the Old Testament strictly banned the operation.&nbsp;But it became very difficult to sterilize the wooden and bone tools.</p><p>The revival of the art and practice of tattooing, particularly in Tonga in recent years.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/polynesian-forearm-tattoo/">Polynesian Armband Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roses are a complex flower and a popular tattoo. Obvious symbolism may be delicate&nbsp;beauty or&nbsp;love, but there is a wealth of culture behind rose symbolism that can be different based on different elements, including color and whether or not the rose is “open.”</p><p>The number of petals on a rose is commonly associated with&nbsp;numerology.</p><p>In mythology, Aphrodite (the Greek goddess of love) was often depicted with roses adorning her head, feet, and neck. This can be interpreted many ways, but the association comes from a rose bush that grew within a pool of blood spilled by her slain lover (Adonis), and so a common interpretation is that the rose symbolizes&nbsp;<strong>an immortal love</strong>&nbsp;that withstands time and even death.</p><p>Roses are not only a beautiful flower but have been the popular choice for both men and women for a tattoo since the 1930’s; but what does the rose symbolize.&nbsp; Your first thought may be in regard to its delicate beauty or its representation of love, inner and outer beauty and whilst you would be right there is also so much more to this beautiful flower.</p><p>As a depiction of love it can be a symbol of being in love particularly when the rose is without thorns, or with as a reminder that love does not come without certain sacrifices when the thorns are present. So even the thorns have their meaning, some say that when thorns are present on the tattoo it means the person does not place a great deal of emphasis on outer beauty, whilst for others, the tattoo refers to endless beauty with the thorn meaning you can look but you can’t touch.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo History</strong></p><p>The rose originated in Persia it is a masculine symbol, Over the years. It has become associated with femininity, however, the flower is popular with both men and women. Although the rose tattoo carries a plethora of meanings today, it used to only represent love.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Rose and Skull: </strong>The skull is a strong symbol of overcoming challenges or the death of an enemy. Combined with the rose, this tattoo is a representation of life after death—conquering an enemy and starting a new life. The most famous design depicts a rose growing out of a skull&#8217;s eye sockets. Some people like having the skull wearing the rose on its head.</li><li><strong>Anchor and Rose: </strong>This is a classic nautical tattoo that represents the commitment to a loved one.</li><li><strong>Rose and Dagger:</strong> These two contrasting elements can make for a visually striking tattoo that is imbued with profound meaning. The dagger stands for betrayal, ruthlessness, and death. A tattoo design that depicts a dagger stabbing a rose could represent the wearer&#8217;s belief that evil always conquers innocence. It could also symbolize heartbreak, especially if you add a few blood drops falling from a drooping rose. A dagger tattoo with rose vines wrapped around it represents the duality of human life and our constant struggle with good and evil. A tattoo of a rose&#8217;s thorny vines choking a dagger means that good always trumps evil or that true love is possible after a heartbreak.</li><li><strong>Rose and Clock:  </strong>A tattoo design that has a clock with no hands and a rose symbolizes endless love. Combined with the rose, this design could be a symbol of a certain romance in your past. Or it could represent an anniversary date.</li><li><strong>Rose and Dove:</strong> Dove tattoos are usually tributes to someone who has passed away. A rose and dove tattoo design can serve as a tribute to a loved one who has gone.</li></ul><p><strong>Symbol of balance</strong></p><p>A&nbsp;<strong>yellow rose</strong>&nbsp;symbolizes joy, protection against envious lovers, and a mature love.</p><p><strong>White roses</strong>&nbsp;symbolize purity, mysticism, and a secret admirer.</p><p><strong>Red roses </strong>symbolize romance or passionate love,&nbsp; also represent sacrifice or memorial.</p><p><strong>Pink roses</strong>&nbsp;are representative of healing, first love, and innocence.</p><p><strong>Blue roses</strong>&nbsp;signify the unattainable or the impossible.</p><p><strong>Black roses</strong>&nbsp;are a symbol of death and farewell. (This is not necessarily morbid; it can carry a message of a memorial.)</p><p>#tattoopins #botanicalflower #tattooartist #tattoomoscow #tattooinrussia #graphictattoo #wowtattoo #tattsketches #tattoodesign #moscowtattoo #equilattera #tattooselection #inkspiretattoos #womantattoo #taot #rostratattoo #tattooapprentice #tattooflash #sisterstattoo #sister #blackandgreytattoo #tattooshop #pinnacletattoo #colortattoo #weldertattoo #weldingtattoo #blackandgreysociety #blackandgreytattoos #customtattoos #skulltattoo</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/rose-tattoo/">Abstract Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazing <strong>Maori Armband Tattoo</strong></p><p>Maori tattoos are begin in New Zealand. They started from a love affair between a very young man called Mataora and a princess whose name was Niwareka who was from the underworld.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The use of tattoos as a form of body adornment is not something recent but has been a part of human culture and existence for centuries now. When we talk of tattoo art in ancient context, it would be hard to skip Polynesian tattoos because many of the tattoo designs used in modern tattoo art have their roots in the Polynesian islands. The ancient history dating back to centuries makes these tattoos even more interesting and alluring. In those times, getting Polynesian tattoos meant a great deal of pain and endurance and this in no way, waned the popularity of these tattoos amongst the people of these island and the tattoos still enjoy a great deal of popularity. Tattoos were in fact a part of the culture of these islands and they were something necessary for the natives belonging to the tribes which resided in the islands of Samoa, Tonga, Tahiti, Easter Island, the Marquesa Islands, the Cook Islands, New Zealand and Hawaii, all of which come under Polynesian Islands.</p><p>Symbolic Meanings of Polynesian Tattoos</p><p>Basically, Polynesian tattoos varied in symbolic meanings depending upon the culture of the island they came from, with each island having its own customs and traditions. In general, these tattoos symbolized courage and sexual attractiveness. Some people took them as a symbol of the rite of passage, while others took them as a protective talisman. Getting these tattoos needed a lot of pain bearing endurance which linked them with strength and courage. Polynesian tattoos stood for the social rank and status of the bearer.</p><p><strong>Tattoos of Different Polynesian Islands</strong></p><p>Polynesia comprises of more than 1000 islands spread out in the Pacific Ocean, with each island having its distinct culture and customs. As a result, the tattoo designs and their symbolic values too vary from one place to another. Here are some meanings of Polynesian tattoos based on the culture of their place of origin:</p><p><strong>The Marquesa Island Tattoos</strong></p><p>It is believed that the first tribal people of Polynesia came to the Marquesa Islands and it is from here that they spread around to various other Polynesian Islands. As such, tattoos were an important part of the culture of the Marquesa Islands and they were specifically borne for aesthetic purposes. People had tattoos inked to appear more attractive and at the same time, they marked the rites of passage through different phases of life.</p><p><strong>Hawaiian Tattoos</strong></p><p>In Hawaiian culture, tattoos were considered to be more personalized in nature, with respect to the fact that they conveyed a meaning related to the bearer. Another purpose of tattoos in this culture was that they were considered as a protective talisman, besides being a way of embellishing one’s body. Some people bore the tattoos as a mark of honor of a deceased loved one. The most popular Hawaiian tattoo designs included the abstract tribal patterns, flowers and turtles.</p><p><strong>Samoan Tattoos</strong></p><p>In Samoa, tattoos were meant to signify the social status of the bearer, with large sized tattoos being sported by men and women. Since the tattoos were large and intricate, narrating everything about a person, from his age to his social standing, rank and place in life. Getting them inked was a matter of great pain and endurance as they were ink with the tooth of a pig or shark rather than a needle. It was essential to have the tattoo completed once it was started, otherwise it was a matter of disgrace for the tattoo bearer. The Samoan tattoos for men were big in size reaching from below the rib cage to the ankles, and they are called pe’a. On the other hand, the feminine tattoos or malu, were large in size but lacked the black areas. Most of the Samoan women have tattoos inked on their hands.</p><p><strong>The Maori Tattoos of New Zealand</strong></p><p>New Zealand is inhabited by the Maori Tribe and these people are famous for creating a unique style in tattoo art. The designs comprise of spirals and each design is modified as the bearer passes though a new stage in life. This is like a ritual in which a design is changed with the passage of time and it may take years and years to attain a complete look. These tattoos stand for courage, strength status and passion of the bearer.</p><p><strong>Tahitian Tattoos</strong></p><p>Tahiti is also known by the name of French Polynesia and in this island, only people of high social status had the right to be inked. These tattoos were spread over the entire body of the bearer, with the exception of the face area. Both men and women had these tattoos and they symbolized passage of various stages of human existence. Women were inked at a young aged and these tattoos were modified as they got mature. Tattoos played a key role for a woman to attract a partner.</p><p><strong>Easter Island Tattoos</strong></p><p>In the culture of Easter Island, it was believed that the body of a person becomes sacred once it is inked with tattoos and he is able to communicate with the divine. These tattoos were borne by both men and women and the most common design was that constituting of dots and lines extending from one ear to the other, covering the forehead of the bearer. Other elements used in Easter Island tattoos included spears, boats, birds and turtles.</p><p><strong>Tonga Tattoos</strong></p><p>Tonga tattoos are very similar to Samoan tattoos in the respect that they had a story to narrate, including personal facts about the bearer such as his age, social status and his journey through life. These tattoos are more like the life story of the tattoo bearer, rather than a form of body art.</p><p><strong>Cook Island Tattoos</strong></p><p>Cook Island tattoos comprised of large designs which covered the entire body of the bearer. Each tribe had its own designs and the bearer had a design of his tribe inked on his body.</p><p><strong>Tiki Tattoo</strong></p><p>In addition to the tattoos mentioned above, which related to the cultures of the tribes which they came from, another popular form of Polynesian tattoos is the Tiki tattoo art. Tiki was the first human being according to Polynesian belief and most of the temples of the Polynesia have a statue of this mythical ancestor. The face and hand of Tiki statues are adorned with distinctive Tiki tattoos.</p><p>Despite being a figment of the ancient past, Polynesian tattoos continue to rule the world in terms of popularity and are loved by those tattoo lovers who are particularly in love with history and tradition. They represent a journey through the rich past and have a matchless charm, very different from the contemporary tattoos. Such is their attraction value, that many global celebrities have been seen sporting tattoos rooted in the ancient Polynesian art. One of these celebrities is Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock, whose left shoulder is adorned with a Marquesan tattoo. Despite having crossed centuries in their journey, Polynesian tattoos continue to attract the attention of tattoo bearers as well as artists around the world because of their amazing aesthetic beauty and great symbolic value. In those times, tattoos were used to denote social status but today, they are revered because of their good looks and unique designs.</p><p>#polynesiantattoo #polynesian #tattoo #tattoos #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/polynesian-tattoo/">Polynesian Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solid Arm Band Tattoo by Black Poison Tattoos</p><p>If you are deciding on getting an armband tattoo you are in luck because there are so many options when it comes to this tattoo. Almost any idea that you have can be turned into an armband tattoo. Many people get tribal tattoos, Celtic tattoos and Polynesian tattoos in this area. So if you are thinking about getting a tribal, Celtic or Polynesian tattoo and are unsure of where you want to place it, consider getting this type of tattoo. Some people select an animal that they want to get tattooed and have it go around the arm, like a dragon tattoo which is a good armband tattoo option for men and women. A good armband tattoo idea for women is to get a ring of flowers around the arm. Colorful swirls and stars is another option that looks really nice. If you are a music lover you can have a tattoo of musical notes on a staff circling your arm. Armband tattoos can be thick or they can be skinny, they can be dark or they can be light. The possibilities are endless when it comes to getting an armband tattoo design for both men and women.</p><p>When most people think about armband tattoos, they think of it as being in only one place on the arm. Most armband tattoos are found around the bicep or upper arm area. However, it is also very common to get an armband tattoo on the lower arm, just below the elbow. Another location for this tattoo, though not as common as the previous two just mentioned, is around the wrist. Where you place your armband tattoo is up to you as it is all about personal preference any location on the arm can be just as good as any other.</p><p>Armband tattoo designs are not known for their meanings. Most people believe that an armband tattoo is simply chosen for its aesthetic value. And this true for the most part. However, there are meanings behind particular armband tattoos that you may not be aware of and can add more depth to your decision, or could make you reconsider getting your chosen tattoo design. For example, the very common barbed wire tattoo and the solid black armband tattoo are actually considered dark and even scary symbols in Russia and Japan, respectively. These symbols were often worn by convicts or mafia-type individuals. The location of where the armband was placed, especially for the Russian barbed wire tattoo, had just as much meaning as the barbed wire tattoo itself. However, the tough history behind armband tattoos can enhance the bad-boy attractiveness of men. On a brighter note, in Hawaii any water-based or themed armband tattoo may represent aboriginal Hawaiian pride. While most armband tattoos are selected solely based on their design, it is also useful to know the meaning behind why certain tattoo designs are chosen for this part of the body.</p><p>Armband tattoos are definitely one of the coolest places to get a tattoo. For men especially, they emphasize the bicep which is a highly regarded part of the body in female eyes. This tattoo is a popular option for women as well. Now that you know more about the flexibility this tattoo provides for tattoo design ideas, where this tattoo is most commonly placed on the arm and the meaning behind certain armband tattoos for men, you can start coming up with designs of your own that are unique, interesting, and meaningful.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/solid-arm-band-tattoo/">Solid Arm Band Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
