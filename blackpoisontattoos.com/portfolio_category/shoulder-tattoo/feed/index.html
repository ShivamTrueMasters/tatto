										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of Hindu symbolism offers a treasure trove of imagery for meaningful tattoos. Among these, the Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo stands out as a powerful representation of inner transformation and spiritual guidance. This blog post delves into the symbolism behind this unique design, exploring its historical significance and potential interpretations for the modern wearer.</p><p><strong>The Dance of Destruction and Renewal</strong></p><p>Shiva, the Hindu god of transformation, is often depicted in the ecstatic dance of Tandava. This cosmic dance represents the continual cycle of creation, destruction, and renewal within the universe. The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo frequently features Shiva in this dynamic pose, his body adorned with serpents and flames, symbolizing the transformative power he wields.</p><p><strong>The Guiding Presence of the Rishi</strong></p><p>Juxtaposed against Shiva&#8217;s energetic dance is the serene figure of a Rishi, a wise sage or seer. The Rishi acts as a counterpoint to Shiva&#8217;s dynamism, representing the wisdom and guidance needed to navigate the transformative process. In the tattoo, the Rishi is often depicted in a meditative posture, offering a sense of grounding and spiritual insight.</p><p><strong>Unveiling the Layers of Meaning</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo resonates with wearers on multiple levels. Here&#8217;s a deeper look at the symbolism it embodies:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Transformation and Rebirth:</strong> Shiva&#8217;s dance signifies the constant change inherent in life. By incorporating this image, the wearer acknowledges their own journey of growth and transformation.</li>

<li><strong>Inner Power and Destruction of Ego:</strong> The flames surrounding Shiva represent the burning away of illusion and ego. The tattoo serves as a reminder of the potential for immense inner power that lies within each of us.</li>

<li><strong>Seeking Guidance and Wisdom:</strong> The Rishi embodies the wisdom and knowledge needed to navigate life&#8217;s challenges. The tattoo signifies the wearer&#8217;s openness to guidance and spiritual growth.</li>

<li><strong>Balance and Duality:</strong> The contrasting figures of Shiva and the Rishi represent the inherent duality within the universe – destruction and creation, chaos and order. The tattoo serves as a reminder of the importance of finding balance within oneself.</li></ul><p><strong>Beyond Symbolism: Personal Interpretations</strong></p><p>The beauty of the Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo lies in its ability to hold personal meaning for the wearer. Some interpretations include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>A Commitment to Spiritual Growth:</strong> The tattoo can symbolize a dedication to self-discovery and a willingness to embrace life&#8217;s transformative experiences.</li>

<li><strong>Overcoming Challenges:</strong> It can represent the courage to face inner demons and emerge stronger from difficult times.</li>

<li><strong>Honoring Lineage and Tradition:</strong> The Rishi can signify a connection to one&#8217;s spiritual lineage or a particular guru who has offered guidance.</li></ul><p><strong>Considering the Design</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo can be rendered in various artistic styles, from traditional Hindu art forms like Kolam or Madhubani to contemporary black and grey or vibrant illustrative styles. The choice of style ultimately depends on the wearer&#8217;s personal preferences and the desired level of detail.</p><p><strong>Placement and Size</strong></p><p>The size and placement of the tattoo can also hold significance. A larger, more elaborate design on the back or chest can represent a deep commitment to the symbolism, while a smaller, more discreet piece on the arm or ankle might offer a more personal reminder.</p><p><strong>Finding the Right Artist</strong></p><p>Given the intricate nature of the design, choosing a skilled tattoo artist with experience in Hindu iconography is crucial. Look for an artist who can capture the essence of the symbolism and translate it into a visually stunning and culturally respectful tattoo.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: A Powerful Talisman for Inner Transformation</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo is more than just a decorative piece of body art. It&#8217;s a powerful symbol that can serve as a constant reminder of the transformative potential within each of us. By understanding the rich symbolism behind this design, you can embark on a journey of self-discovery and embrace the power of inner transformation.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/shiva-rishi-tattoo/">Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Introduction</h2><p>In the realm of body art, tattoos have transcended mere fashion statements to become powerful symbols of personal beliefs and spiritual expressions. One such captivating tattoo design is the closed eye Shiva tattoo adorned with Sanskrit mantra script. This article takes you on a journey into the world of spirituality, art, and symbolism that this unique tattoo design encapsulates.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-understanding-the-closed-eye-shiva-tattoo">2. Understanding the Closed Eye Shiva Tattoo</h2><p>Imagine a tattoo that not only adorns your body but also serves as a conduit to connect with the divine. The closed eye Shiva tattoo accomplishes just that. Depicting Lord Shiva, the cosmic dancer and destroyer of evil, with his eyes gently shut, this design encapsulates the idea of introspection and the power of meditation.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-the-power-of-lord-shiva-in-hinduism">3. The Power of Lord Shiva in Hinduism</h2><p>Hinduism reveres Lord Shiva as the embodiment of transformation and destruction. His closed eyes symbolize the withdrawal from the external world into deep meditation, signifying the detachment from material desires. Through this tattoo, individuals seek to embrace Shiva&#8217;s strength and inner peace.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-sanskrit-mantras-language-of-the-divine">4. Sanskrit Mantras: Language of the Divine</h2><p>Sanskrit, the ancient language of Hindu scriptures, carries a vibration that resonates with the cosmos. Integrating Sanskrit mantras into the tattoo design not only adds an artistic element but also infuses the tattoo with spiritual energy. Each mantra holds a unique significance, enhancing the overall symbolism of the tattoo.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-symbolism-of-closed-eye-in-the-tattoo">5. Symbolism of Closed Eye in the Tattoo</h2><p>The closed eyes of the Shiva tattoo represent the world within – a universe of thoughts, emotions, and spiritual awakening. Just as Shiva&#8217;s meditation leads to the creation of the universe, the closed eye symbolizes the potential for inner creation and self-realization.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-incorporating-sanskrit-script-in-the-design">6. Incorporating Sanskrit Script in the Design</h2><p>The graceful curves of Sanskrit script not only enhance the visual appeal of the tattoo but also evoke a sense of reverence. Whether it&#8217;s the &#8220;Om&#8221; symbol, representing the ultimate reality, or a mantra invoking divine blessings, each stroke of the script narrates a story of devotion and connection.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-choosing-the-right-placement">7. Choosing the Right Placement</h2><p>The placement of a tattoo holds its own symbolism. Placing the closed eye Shiva tattoo near the heart chakra signifies the unity of mind, body, and soul. Alternatively, on the forearm, it serves as a constant reminder of the divine path amidst the chaos of daily life.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-the-tattooing-process">8. The Tattooing Process</h2><p>Crafting a closed eye Shiva tattoo requires the skillful hands of a tattoo artist who understands its intricate design. The process is not just about needles and ink; it&#8217;s a spiritual journey that merges the artist&#8217;s talent with the individual&#8217;s intention, resulting in a masterpiece that resonates with both.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-9-caring-for-your-spiritual-tattoo">9. Caring for Your Spiritual Tattoo</h2><p>Just as a spiritual journey requires nurturing, so does your tattoo. Adequate aftercare ensures the longevity of both the art and its meaning. Proper skincare and protection from the sun play a role in maintaining the vibrancy of the tattoo and its significance.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-connecting-with-your-inner-self">10. Connecting with Your Inner Self</h2><p>Beyond its visual appeal, the closed eye Shiva tattoo serves as a mirror to your inner world. It invites you to embark on a journey of self-discovery, encouraging introspection and contemplation. The tattoo becomes a silent guide on your path to spiritual growth.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-11-expressing-devotion-through-body-art">11. Expressing Devotion through Body Art</h2><p>Tattoos have always been a medium of self-expression. The closed eye Shiva tattoo goes a step further by allowing individuals to express their devotion openly. It&#8217;s a way of wearing your spirituality on your skin, sharing your beliefs with the world.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-12-shiva-tattoo-as-a-form-of-meditation">12. Shiva Tattoo as a Form of Meditation</h2><p>The process of getting a tattoo itself can be meditative. The rhythmic buzz of the tattoo machine, coupled with the anticipation of the final result, creates a unique meditative experience. This aligns with the essence of Shiva&#8217;s closed eyes, where meditation leads to profound insights.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-13-embracing-spirituality-in-modern-times">13. Embracing Spirituality in Modern Times</h2><p>In a fast-paced world, the closed eye Shiva tattoo offers a tangible connection to spirituality. It&#8217;s a reminder that amidst the chaos, finding moments of serenity and connection is essential for our well-being. This tattoo bridges the gap between ancient wisdom and contemporary living.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-14-conclusion">14. Conclusion</h2><p>The closed eye Shiva tattoo with Sanskrit mantra script is not just ink on skin; it&#8217;s a journey of the soul, a reflection of devotion, and a portal to self-discovery. As you adorn this spiritual masterpiece, remember that it represents more than art – it&#8217;s a symbol of your quest for inner awakening and the divine connection that resides within you.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs">FAQs</h2><p><strong>What is the significance of Lord Shiva&#8217;s closed eyes? </strong></p><p>Lord Shiva&#8217;s closed eyes symbolize deep meditation, detachment from material desires, and inner peace.</p><p><strong>Why are Sanskrit mantras important in the tattoo design? </strong></p><p>Sanskrit mantras infuse the tattoo with spiritual energy and carry vibrations that resonate with the cosmos.</p><p><strong>Where is the best placement for a closed eye Shiva tattoo? </strong></p><p>Placing the tattoo near the heart chakra or on the forearm adds symbolism and personal meaning.</p><p><strong>How does the tattooing process become a spiritual journey? </strong></p><p>The process involves merging the artist&#8217;s skill with the individual&#8217;s intention, creating a meaningful masterpiece.</p><p><strong>Can non-Hindu individuals get this tattoo? </strong></p><p>Absolutely.

He is known as the remover of obstacles and the god of beginnings, intellect, wisdom, and success. The tattoo may symbolize the qualities of Ganesha, such as wisdom, knowledge, and his ability to overcome obstacles. People often get Ganesha tattoos as a way to seek his blessings and protection in their endeavors.</li>

<li><strong>Are Ganesha tattoos only significant to Hindus?</strong> Ganesha tattoos have their roots in Hinduism, and for Hindus, they hold deep spiritual and religious significance. However, in recent times, Ganesha tattoos have become popular among people from various cultural backgrounds and belief systems. Some individuals may choose a Ganesha tattoo because they appreciate the symbolism and meanings associated with Lord Ganesha, regardless of their religious affiliation.</li>

<li><strong>Can I get a Ganesha tattoo even if I am not religious?</strong> Yes, you can certainly get a Ganesha tattoo even if you are not religious. As mentioned earlier, many people opt for Ganesha tattoos because of the positive qualities and symbolism associated with Lord Ganesha, such as wisdom, intelligence, and the ability to overcome obstacles. The tattoo can be seen as a representation of these values, rather than solely as a religious symbol. People from various backgrounds choose Ganesha tattoos as a way to embrace the positive aspects represented by this deity.</li>

<li><strong>What are the best colors to use in a Ganesha tattoo?</strong> The choice of colors for a Ganesha tattoo can vary based on personal preferences and the tattoo artist&#8217;s style.

<li><strong>Do Ganesha tattoos bring good luck?</strong> The belief in whether Ganesha tattoos bring good luck largely depends on an individual&#8217;s faith and cultural background. In Hinduism, Ganesha is revered as a deity who removes obstacles and brings blessings, so having a Ganesha tattoo may be seen as a way to seek his protection and favor. However, from a non-religious perspective, some people may consider the tattoo to represent positive qualities like wisdom, intellect, and determination, which could be seen as a source of inspiration or &#8220;good luck&#8221; in facing life&#8217;s challenges.</li></ol><p>Remember that getting a tattoo is a personal choice, and it&#8217;s essential to consider its meaning and significance to you before getting inked. It&#8217;s also a good idea to research tattoo artists and studios to ensure you get a high-quality and well-executed tattoo.</p><p>Remember, a Ganesha tattoo is not merely a piece of art; it is a spiritual journey that unlocks the gates to divine wisdom, providing guidance and strength to the spiritual souls who wear it with reverence.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/discover-the-mesmerizing-lord-ganesha-tattoo-for-spiritual-souls/">Discover the Mesmerizing Lord Ganesha Tattoo for Spiritual Souls</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos have been used for centuries to express personal style, beliefs, and memories. One popular tattoo design that has stood the test of time is the pocket watch tattoo with a name and birth date on the shoulder. This design not only looks beautiful but also carries a deep and personal meaning for the wearer. In this article, we will explore the origins of the pocket watch tattoo, the symbolism behind it, and how to design the perfect pocket watch tattoo with a name and birth date.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Origins of Pocket Watch Tattoos</h2><p>Pocket watch tattoos have a long history dating back to the 17th century when pocket watches were first invented. Pocket watches were once a symbol of prestige and wealth, and were often passed down as family heirlooms. The intricate designs and mechanical workings of pocket watches made them fascinating to artists, who began to incorporate them into their art and designs.</p><p>Over time, pocket watch tattoos became a popular tattoo design, especially among those who wanted to honour a loved one or commemorate a special moment in time. The addition of a name and birth date to the tattoo further personalizes the design and gives it a deeper meaning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The symbolism of Pocket Watch Tattoos</h2><p>Pocket watch tattoos symbolize the importance of time and the fleeting nature of life. The ticking of a pocket watch serves as a constant reminder to cherish every moment and to make the most of the time we have. By adding a name and birth date, the tattoo becomes a tribute to a loved one who has passed away or a reminder of a special moment in the wearer&#8217;s life.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Designing the Perfect Pocket Watch Tattoo</h2><p>When designing a pocket watch tattoo with a name and birth date, there are many factors to consider. The size, placement, and style of the tattoo will all play a role in creating the perfect design.</p><p><strong>Size and Placement:</strong> Pocket watch tattoos can be as small or as large as you want them to be. Some people prefer a small, delicate design that can be easily hidden, while others opt for a larger, more intricate design that covers their entire shoulders. The placement of the tattoo on the shoulder is also important. Many people choose to place the tattoo on their dominant shoulder so that they can easily see it throughout the day.</p><p><strong>Style:</strong> Pocket watch tattoos can be designed in many different styles, from traditional to modern. Traditional pocket watch tattoos often feature a detailed design with intricate gears and clock hands, while modern designs may be more minimalist with simple lines and shapes. The font used for the name and birth date can also influence the overall style of the tattoo.</p><p>Colour: Pocket watch tattoos can be done in black and grey or in full colour. The choice of colour will depend on personal preference and the overall design of the tattoo.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, a pocket watch tattoo with a name and birth date is a timeless and meaningful design that carries a deep personal significance for the wearer. By incorporating the symbolism of time and the fleeting nature of life, this tattoo serves as a reminder to cherish every moment and to honour those we have loved and lost. When designing a pocket watch tattoo, be sure to consider the size, placement, style, and colour of the tattoo to create the perfect design that is uniquely yours.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/pocket-watch-tattoo/">Pocket Watch Tattoo with Name &amp; Birth Date on Shoulder: Timeless and Meaningful Ink</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Throughout the book, It is generally refer to as male due to usually appearing as Pennywise. The Losers come to believe It may be female (because it lays eggs), and perceiving It&#8217;s true form as a monstrous giant spider. However, It&#8217;s true appearance is briefly observed by Bill Denbrough via the Ritual of Chüd as a mass of swirling destructive orange lights known as &#8220;deadlights&#8221;, which inflict insanity or death on any living being that sees them directly. The only person to survive the ordeal is Bill&#8217;s wife Audra Phillips, although she is rendered temporarily catatonic by the experience.</p><p>Its natural enemy is the &#8220;Space Turtle&#8221; or &#8220;Maturin&#8221;, another ancient dweller of King&#8217;s &#8220;Macroverse&#8221; who, eons ago, created the known universe and possibly others by vomiting them out as the result of a stomachache.</p><p>The Turtle appears again in King&#8217;s series&nbsp;<i>The Dark Tower</i>.&nbsp;<i>Wizard and Glass</i>, one of the novels in the series.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wolf Tattoo &#8211; Out of all the birds in <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">mythology and symbolism</a>, there is no greater or more recognized than the crow or raven. This large, blackbird has long been one of the smartest animals on earth, a lover of shiny objects, and perhaps even an intuitive trickster.</p><p>Wolf tattoos are very popular and consider to be the mainstream tattoos. They can be design in a variety of different ways and portrayed with different elements and symbols. Just like all animal tattoos, the wolf tattoo represents the traits and attributes of the wolf. The wolf is a very symbolic creature that holds deep meaning for many different cultures. Throughout history, most notably with Native Americans. To numerous tribes across North America and in other parts of the world, wolves are very powerful and important.</p><p>The eye of Providence design is also by the secret society of the Free Masons, DARPA. And on the official seal of Colorado.</p><p>The all-seeing eye’s usage by government entities, the Federal Reserve, and secret societies. Which led some to believe that the symbol also holds a darker connotation.</p><p>Those who follow this line of thought believe that the all-seeing eye is used as a subconscious marker or a way to denote covert control of the world by a group of ultra-elite oligarchs, leaders of industry and politicians, known as the “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><span class="s1">illuminati</span></a>”, or “enlightened ones”.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/wolf-tattoo/">Wolf Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">The significance<b> of Crescent Moon on Lord Shiva’s Head</b></a></p><p>Shiva Tattva is where there is no mind and the moon signifies the mind. When there is no mind then how can this ‘no-mindedness’ be expressed and how can anybody understand it? You need a little bit of the mind to understand, experience and to express.</p><p>The no-mind, infinite consciousness requires that little bit of mind to express itself in the manifest world. So, to express that inexpressible, that little mind (crescent moon) is on the head.<br>Wisdom is beyond the mind, but it needs to be expressed with a tinge of mind and this is symbolized by the crescent moon.</p><p><b>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Damru</b></p><p><b>Damru</b>&nbsp;symbolizes the Universe which is always expanding and collapsing. From an expansion it collapses and then it re-expands, this is the process of creation.<br>If you see your heartbeat, it is not just one straight line but it is a rhythm that goes up and down. The whole world is nothing but rhythms; energy rising and collapsing to rise again. So the&nbsp;damru&nbsp;signifies that. Look at the shape of the&nbsp;damru, from expansion it collapses and again expands.</p><p>Lord shiva tattoo &#8211; The darmru is also a symbol of sound. Sound is rhythm and sound is energy. The whole universe is nothing but a wave function, it is nothing but rhythms. What does quantum physics say? It says the same thing – the whole universe is nothing but rhythms. It is just one wave (Adviata). So the damru signifies the non-dual nature of the universe.</p><p><b>Significance of Serpent around Lord Shiva’s Neck</b></p><p>A state of samadhi where there is nothing, just the inner sky of consciousness, is Shiva; where there is alertness and no action. To describe this alertness they put a snake around Shiva’s neck. So the&nbsp;<b>serpent</b>&nbsp;is a symbol of&nbsp;<b>alertness</b>.</p><p>In the state of meditation when the eyes are closed, it gives the impression that the person is sleeping, but he is not asleep, he is alert. To express this state of consciousness, a&nbsp;<b>snake</b>&nbsp;is shown around Lord Shiva’s neck.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><b>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Trishul (Trident)-Lord shiva tattoo</b></a></p><p><b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;represents the three aspects of consciousness – waking, dreaming and sleeping, and it represents the three&nbsp;gunas – satva, rajas&nbsp;and&nbsp;tamas. Holding a&nbsp;trishul&nbsp;(Trident) signifies that Shiva (the divinity) is above all the three states – waking, dreaming and sleeping, yet is the upholder of these three states.<br>The divinity is beyond the three gunas, but it holds the three&nbsp;gunas&nbsp;together.</p><p><b>Shul</b>&nbsp;means problems or suffering.&nbsp;<b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;means that which destroys all kind of suffering.<br>Three types of pain that arise in life:<br>1.&nbsp;Aadibhautik&nbsp;(physical)<br>2.&nbsp;Aadhyaatmik&nbsp;(spiritual) and<br>3.&nbsp;Aadidaivik&nbsp;(ethereal)<br>What relieves you from all the problems and suffering is the&nbsp;trishul. And it is in the hand of Shiva.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-shiva-tattoo-4/">Lord Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Om and Its Meaning in Hinduism</strong></p><p>As we mentioned before, the Om symbol has various meanings and uses throughout Hinduism. Now, we will have a look at some of the most common and well-known meanings of the Om symbol in the religion.</p><p>According to Hindu beliefs, “the essence of all beings on earth, the essence of earth is water, the essence of water are plants, the essence of plants are men, the essence of men is the speech, the essence of speech is the Rig Veda, the essence of the Rig Veda is the Sama Veda, and the essence of Sama Veda is Om.”</p><p>The older Upanishads also state that the Om symbol represents the struggle between the gods and demons. This is not actually meant to represent true gods and demons, but the inclinations of good and evil within humans. In other words, it is allegorical in nature.</p><p>Also, the Om symbol is implied to be that thing in humans which inspires good and altruistic actions and thoughts.</p><p>On a side note, within the Mandukya Upanishad, Om is mentioned as “the syllable of the whole world.”</p><p>In the first verse of this Upanishad, it states that time is made of three parts. The past, present, and future, or in other words A, U, and M.</p><p>Subsequent verses suggest that the Om is something like an “acknowledgment. A melodic confirmation, and something that gives energy to a hymn”.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/om-tattoo/">Om Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sagittarius is the 9th sign that features in the zodiac wheel. It is also among the final 3 fire signs of the zodiac collection. It is mostly represented by an archer or the symbol of an archer. This archer will have a bow and an arrow and will be joined to a horse. Basically, it is a sign that shows half a person and half horse. The body of the human being is what will replace the head of the horse, but the other part is complete of a horse. The sign also represents people born between November the 23rd and December the 21st.</p><p>The Sagittarius Sign Tattoo or character can be applied on the body and they represent pride, passion, fury, courage, and independence.</p><p>The wearer of the tattoo will most likely have these personalities. They are also persons that can face any sort of challenge, without fear.</p><p>All of us are possessive about our identity and it means a lot to us. We express it in different ways and the sun sign tattoos are also a way of expressing our identity. People who belong to the Sagittarius sun sign are natural tattoo lovers as they are blessed with an artistic bent of mind. They love to explore and research and are also very fiery and straight-forward. The Sagittarius tattoos are best for conveying the fact that one was born under the ninth sign of the zodiac and is ruled by the fire element.</p><p>The tattoo has got a very sexy display and stands out from all other sun signs tattoos. The centaur and the archer represent the Sagittarians. The arrow is the symbol of the ardent and passionate sun sign. Men and women love both the designs. Those who want a simple and cute look generally go for the symbol while the ones wishing for an elaborate and catchy display choose the centaur and the archer.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/sagittarius-zodiac-tattoo/">Sagittarius Sign Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Wolf Head Tattoo</strong></p><p>Many different cultures throughout history, most notably with Native Americans: too numerous tribes across North America and in other parts of the world, wolves are very powerful and important.</p><p><strong>Wolves have survived in harsh locations for tens of thousands of years.</strong></p><p>They are intelligent and skillful hunters who rarely hunt alone (unless they have been cast out of the pack). Wolves live and hunt in packs, tight-knit family groups that increase their chances of survival.</p><p>Native Americans viewed the wolf as a totem animal or spirit sent to help guide us through life, symbolizing loyalty and perseverance. In legends, the wolf had great powers given by the Great Spirit. Wolves also had the power to change into people.</p><p><strong>The Wolf Head Tattoo is a very symbolic creature that holds deep meaning.</strong></p><p>Wolves are strongly associated with the family. Because they live and hunt in packs, they have survived. The pack also gives them a territorial advantage against other predators. A wolf will only mate with one partner while the pair is alive. Because they mate for life, and because the whole pack will help take care of the pups, wolves are also known as caring parents. Thus a wolf tattoo can symbolize tight family bonds.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/wolf-head-tattoo/">Wolf Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>St Michael the archangel tattoo</strong></p><p>St Michael, known otherwise as Michael the Archangel, can be found fifteen times throughout the Bible. Not to mention, a quick glance in the lexicon and you’ll discover “the name of an archangel and nine Israelites written in Greek and Hebrew dictionaries.</p><p>When it comes to Saint Michael, what makes this archangel and prince so popularly renowned?</p><p>Well, it starts with the Book of Daniel, where he is referred to as “the great prince who stands up for the children of your people.”</p><p>Elsewhere, like in the Book of Revelation, text can found depicting his war in the heavens with Satan’s defeat.</p><p>Aside from other places like the Epistle of Jude, you’ll commonly find St Micheal in other forms like prayer.</p><p>Take for instance the Prayer to Saint Michael, which came to light back in 1886 by Pope Leo XIII. Years later in 1994, even Pope John Paul II was quite the advocate too.</p><p>Yet, when it comes to the meaning of this archangel, you’ll find plenty of inspiration.</p><p><strong>Archangel Tattoo</strong></p><p>When Michael stands guard over Israel, you could say it represents protection. When the Saint opposes Satan, it shows his firm beliefs and willingness to never cower out of fear. In a sense, you could symbolize this an act of bravery. Not to mention, he is also the military commander of certain angels and battles the patron angels of other nations. In other words, the Saint showcases excellent leadership and structure.</p><p>God had made Heaven and the Earth and all the Angels and all the extra important Angels,called Archangels. (Like an extra important Bishop is called an Archbishop.) The Archangels were God&#8217;s very special friends and were Shining and Strong and Powerful. One Archangel was called Gabriel. He was the one that God sent to tell Our Blessed Lady that She was to become the Mother of God, the Mother of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Another Angel was called Raphael; he was the one who helped Tobias in the Bible. Another Archangel was called Michael. Michael was &#8220;the Angel of the Lord&#8221;, who was sent to Moses and Jacob and Abraham and to other people throughout the history of the world. Another Archangel was Lucifer, who was so beautiful that the other Angels called him the Son of the Morning.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/archangel-tattoo/">St Michael the archangel tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roses are a complex flower and a popular tattoo. Obvious symbolism may be delicate&nbsp;beauty or&nbsp;love, but there is a wealth of culture behind rose symbolism that can be different based on different elements, including color and whether or not the rose is “open.”</p><p>The number of petals on a rose is commonly associated with&nbsp;numerology.</p><p>In mythology, Aphrodite (the Greek goddess of love) was often depicted with roses adorning her head, feet, and neck. This can be interpreted many ways, but the association comes from a rose bush that grew within a pool of blood spilled by her slain lover (Adonis), and so a common interpretation is that the rose symbolizes&nbsp;<strong>an immortal love</strong>&nbsp;that withstands time and even death.</p><p>Roses are not only a beautiful flower but have been the popular choice for both men and women for a tattoo since the 1930’s; but what does the rose symbolize.&nbsp; Your first thought may be in regard to its delicate beauty or its representation of love, inner and outer beauty and whilst you would be right there is also so much more to this beautiful flower.</p><p>As a depiction of love it can be a symbol of being in love particularly when the rose is without thorns, or with as a reminder that love does not come without certain sacrifices when the thorns are present. So even the thorns have their meaning, some say that when thorns are present on the tattoo it means the person does not place a great deal of emphasis on outer beauty, whilst for others, the tattoo refers to endless beauty with the thorn meaning you can look but you can’t touch.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo History</strong></p><p>The rose originated in Persia it is a masculine symbol, Over the years. It has become associated with femininity, however, the flower is popular with both men and women. Although the rose tattoo carries a plethora of meanings today, it used to only represent love.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Rose and Skull: </strong>The skull is a strong symbol of overcoming challenges or the death of an enemy. Combined with the rose, this tattoo is a representation of life after death—conquering an enemy and starting a new life. The most famous design depicts a rose growing out of a skull&#8217;s eye sockets. Some people like having the skull wearing the rose on its head.</li><li><strong>Anchor and Rose: </strong>This is a classic nautical tattoo that represents the commitment to a loved one.</li><li><strong>Rose and Dagger:</strong> These two contrasting elements can make for a visually striking tattoo that is imbued with profound meaning. The dagger stands for betrayal, ruthlessness, and death. A tattoo design that depicts a dagger stabbing a rose could represent the wearer&#8217;s belief that evil always conquers innocence. It could also symbolize heartbreak, especially if you add a few blood drops falling from a drooping rose. A dagger tattoo with rose vines wrapped around it represents the duality of human life and our constant struggle with good and evil. A tattoo of a rose&#8217;s thorny vines choking a dagger means that good always trumps evil or that true love is possible after a heartbreak.</li><li><strong>Rose and Clock:  </strong>A tattoo design that has a clock with no hands and a rose symbolizes endless love. Combined with the rose, this design could be a symbol of a certain romance in your past. Or it could represent an anniversary date.</li><li><strong>Rose and Dove:</strong> Dove tattoos are usually tributes to someone who has passed away. A rose and dove tattoo design can serve as a tribute to a loved one who has gone.</li></ul><p><strong>Symbol of balance</strong></p><p>A&nbsp;<strong>yellow rose</strong>&nbsp;symbolizes joy, protection against envious lovers, and a mature love.</p><p><strong>White roses</strong>&nbsp;symbolize purity, mysticism, and a secret admirer.</p><p><strong>Red roses </strong>symbolize romance or passionate love,&nbsp; also represent sacrifice or memorial.</p><p><strong>Pink roses</strong>&nbsp;are representative of healing, first love, and innocence.</p><p><strong>Blue roses</strong>&nbsp;signify the unattainable or the impossible.</p><p><strong>Black roses</strong>&nbsp;are a symbol of death and farewell. (This is not necessarily morbid; it can carry a message of a memorial.)</p><p>#tattoopins #botanicalflower #tattooartist #tattoomoscow #tattooinrussia #graphictattoo #wowtattoo #tattsketches #tattoodesign #moscowtattoo #equilattera #tattooselection #inkspiretattoos #womantattoo #taot #rostratattoo #tattooapprentice #tattooflash #sisterstattoo #sister #blackandgreytattoo #tattooshop #pinnacletattoo #colortattoo #weldertattoo #weldingtattoo #blackandgreysociety #blackandgreytattoos #customtattoos #skulltattoo</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/rose-tattoo/">Abstract Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warriors are popular tattoos which can be designed in an infinite number of forms. A quick look on different websites for tattoos will give you a repertoire of factual and mythical warriors. They are valued for the artistic part and the symbolism they offer. Warriors tattoos are usually done by men, although we do find a few nice warriors tattoed on females.</p><p>If you are looking to put a warrior tattoo design on any part of your body, your biggest problem is ‘choice’. There are so many aspects you can look at, that it is very important that you perform a thorough research so your end decision will be one that will keep you proud and happy for many years.</p><p>Warrior designs are period oriented, geographically located, real or fictitious, and even made up by the person who will be doing the tattoo. An important aspect of the warrior tattoo is the armor and tools he carries. The majority of warriors are men but as can be seen from the pictures below, we can occasionally encounter a beautiful female warrior. A popular female warrior is Pocahontas.</p><p>The choice of warrior tattoo designs is so vast that you will need time to make up your mind which warrior best describes you and your feelings. You can choose from Holy warriors, Greek warriors, Aztec warriors, Roman warriors, Celtic warriors, and Vikings, all of which represent a different aspect of war.</p><p>Other interesting additions to your tattoo are the weapons which range from the normal bow to the crossbows, spears, shields, different type of swords and also the armor and crests. It is very important that the correct armor is used with the kind of warrior you choose. You cannot include a crest which belongs to another era or is known to be the property of a different warrior.</p><p>Last but not least, one should also look at the positioning of the warrior. Usually, the warrior is tattooed standing on top of his enemy to show victory. Other warriors are shown in action, or on a bloody field. Most of the time the person who wants a warrior as a tattoo is looking for an aspect that shows his fighting spirit, bravery and courage, skill and strategy, his fearless character, power, aggressiveness and authority. Which one depicts you?</p><p>Each one of us is a warrior at heart, but whether we want to put this in the form of a tattoo on our skin is another story. If you are a fighter, want to portray some kind of anger, or admire the past and present warriors or soldiers, this might work perfectly for you. You might also be interested in different armour, fighting gear or the shiny swords used in wars. Another genre of such tattoos is movie fighters, which are also commonly asked for as tattoos. Whatever it is, carriers of warrior tattoos definitely have a fighting spirit they want to share with the rest of the world.</p><p>#warriortattoos #warriortattoos #warrior #tattoo #tattoos #tattooinspiration #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #anchortattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #letteringtattoo #liontattoo #skulltattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/warrior-tattoos/">Warrior Tattoos</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Amazing Name Tattoo</strong></p><p>Tattoos are associated with drawings, but another trend is leading it toward more literary content. Lettering tattoos are not simple though.</p><p>Sometimes, words and names begin to be as obsessive that you need to keep them forever on your flesh: the first name of a loved one, a word that describes your rules of life, a sentence written by a talented writer/songwriter or something wise you wish could lead your path. Lettering is probably one of the most personal and meaningful type of a tattoo and that&#8217;s why it is very important to get the right design and tattoo artist. First, make sure to choose the best looking fonts: the size, spacing and readability are extremely important. Even if you want something very small, your tattoo has to be clear and readable from a good distance, or when aging it will completely be illegible.</p><p>Then, check the spelling more than twice with your artist and relatives. Don&#8217;t spend the rest of your life with one of those awful mistakes that you can see around the web. And finally, think it through: what could sound cool one moment is just painful, ridiculous or pointless later, especially if you&#8217;ve got the location wrong (no offensive words on your face, neck and hands please, be polite and act like a grown up). That is said, lettering allows all the fancies, associated with other elements, various fonts or creative tattoo style.</p><p>#nametattoo #lettertattoo #blacklettertattoo #NameInitialTattoo #lettertattoos #name #alphabet #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #anchortattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #letteringtattoo #liontattoo #skulltattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/amazing-name-tattoo/">Amazing Name Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The use of tattoos as a form of body adornment is not something recent but has been a part of human culture and existence for centuries now. When we talk of tattoo art in ancient context, it would be hard to skip Polynesian tattoos because many of the tattoo designs used in modern tattoo art have their roots in the Polynesian islands. The ancient history dating back to centuries makes these tattoos even more interesting and alluring. In those times, getting Polynesian tattoos meant a great deal of pain and endurance and this in no way, waned the popularity of these tattoos amongst the people of these island and the tattoos still enjoy a great deal of popularity. Tattoos were in fact a part of the culture of these islands and they were something necessary for the natives belonging to the tribes which resided in the islands of Samoa, Tonga, Tahiti, Easter Island, the Marquesa Islands, the Cook Islands, New Zealand and Hawaii, all of which come under Polynesian Islands.</p><p>Symbolic Meanings of Polynesian Tattoos</p><p>Basically, Polynesian tattoos varied in symbolic meanings depending upon the culture of the island they came from, with each island having its own customs and traditions. In general, these tattoos symbolized courage and sexual attractiveness. Some people took them as a symbol of the rite of passage, while others took them as a protective talisman. Getting these tattoos needed a lot of pain bearing endurance which linked them with strength and courage. Polynesian tattoos stood for the social rank and status of the bearer.</p><p><strong>Tattoos of Different Polynesian Islands</strong></p><p>Polynesia comprises of more than 1000 islands spread out in the Pacific Ocean, with each island having its distinct culture and customs. As a result, the tattoo designs and their symbolic values too vary from one place to another. Here are some meanings of Polynesian tattoos based on the culture of their place of origin:</p><p><strong>The Marquesa Island Tattoos</strong></p><p>It is believed that the first tribal people of Polynesia came to the Marquesa Islands and it is from here that they spread around to various other Polynesian Islands. As such, tattoos were an important part of the culture of the Marquesa Islands and they were specifically borne for aesthetic purposes. People had tattoos inked to appear more attractive and at the same time, they marked the rites of passage through different phases of life.</p><p><strong>Hawaiian Tattoos</strong></p><p>In Hawaiian culture, tattoos were considered to be more personalized in nature, with respect to the fact that they conveyed a meaning related to the bearer. Another purpose of tattoos in this culture was that they were considered as a protective talisman, besides being a way of embellishing one’s body. Some people bore the tattoos as a mark of honor of a deceased loved one. The most popular Hawaiian tattoo designs included the abstract tribal patterns, flowers and turtles.</p><p><strong>Samoan Tattoos</strong></p><p>In Samoa, tattoos were meant to signify the social status of the bearer, with large sized tattoos being sported by men and women. Since the tattoos were large and intricate, narrating everything about a person, from his age to his social standing, rank and place in life. Getting them inked was a matter of great pain and endurance as they were ink with the tooth of a pig or shark rather than a needle. It was essential to have the tattoo completed once it was started, otherwise it was a matter of disgrace for the tattoo bearer. The Samoan tattoos for men were big in size reaching from below the rib cage to the ankles, and they are called pe’a. On the other hand, the feminine tattoos or malu, were large in size but lacked the black areas. Most of the Samoan women have tattoos inked on their hands.</p><p><strong>The Maori Tattoos of New Zealand</strong></p><p>New Zealand is inhabited by the Maori Tribe and these people are famous for creating a unique style in tattoo art. The designs comprise of spirals and each design is modified as the bearer passes though a new stage in life. This is like a ritual in which a design is changed with the passage of time and it may take years and years to attain a complete look. These tattoos stand for courage, strength status and passion of the bearer.</p><p><strong>Tahitian Tattoos</strong></p><p>Tahiti is also known by the name of French Polynesia and in this island, only people of high social status had the right to be inked. These tattoos were spread over the entire body of the bearer, with the exception of the face area. Both men and women had these tattoos and they symbolized passage of various stages of human existence. Women were inked at a young aged and these tattoos were modified as they got mature. Tattoos played a key role for a woman to attract a partner.</p><p><strong>Easter Island Tattoos</strong></p><p>In the culture of Easter Island, it was believed that the body of a person becomes sacred once it is inked with tattoos and he is able to communicate with the divine. These tattoos were borne by both men and women and the most common design was that constituting of dots and lines extending from one ear to the other, covering the forehead of the bearer. Other elements used in Easter Island tattoos included spears, boats, birds and turtles.</p><p><strong>Tonga Tattoos</strong></p><p>Tonga tattoos are very similar to Samoan tattoos in the respect that they had a story to narrate, including personal facts about the bearer such as his age, social status and his journey through life. These tattoos are more like the life story of the tattoo bearer, rather than a form of body art.</p><p><strong>Cook Island Tattoos</strong></p><p>Cook Island tattoos comprised of large designs which covered the entire body of the bearer. Each tribe had its own designs and the bearer had a design of his tribe inked on his body.</p><p><strong>Tiki Tattoo</strong></p><p>In addition to the tattoos mentioned above, which related to the cultures of the tribes which they came from, another popular form of Polynesian tattoos is the Tiki tattoo art. Tiki was the first human being according to Polynesian belief and most of the temples of the Polynesia have a statue of this mythical ancestor. The face and hand of Tiki statues are adorned with distinctive Tiki tattoos.</p><p>Despite being a figment of the ancient past, Polynesian tattoos continue to rule the world in terms of popularity and are loved by those tattoo lovers who are particularly in love with history and tradition. They represent a journey through the rich past and have a matchless charm, very different from the contemporary tattoos. Such is their attraction value, that many global celebrities have been seen sporting tattoos rooted in the ancient Polynesian art. One of these celebrities is Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock, whose left shoulder is adorned with a Marquesan tattoo. Despite having crossed centuries in their journey, Polynesian tattoos continue to attract the attention of tattoo bearers as well as artists around the world because of their amazing aesthetic beauty and great symbolic value. In those times, tattoos were used to denote social status but today, they are revered because of their good looks and unique designs.</p><p>#polynesiantattoo #polynesian #tattoo #tattoos #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/polynesian-tattoo/">Polynesian Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Trishul &amp; Third Eye Tattoo of Lord Shiva</strong></p><p>Do thorough research on something you&#8217;re likely to get into.</p><p>The Ganga in Shiva’s hair symbolises the end of ignorance. This implies that you should know what you are getting into. Being in denial about facts is not going to help.</p><p><strong>Understand that everything is temporary</strong></p><p>Maha yogis don’t fall for ‘moh maya’. They know that life is ephemeral and what happens today is not going to exist forever. Time changes and so do we.</p><p><strong>Dance</strong></p><p>Lord Shiva is known as Nataraja or the King of Dance. Although his ‘tandav’ destroyed the world, it was also an art that passed on to us.</p><p><strong>Lord Shiva &#8211; The God of Transformation</strong></p><p>Lord Shiva is a part of Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh and is associated with Moksha which is relief from the cycle of birth and death.</p><p>By Moksha, He is actually taking us out from the illusionary world of Kama, Krodha, Moha, Mada and Lobha and making us realize who we are and what is our true purpose of existence. Thus the power of destruction of Lord Shiva has a great purifying power on a universal level. The destruction opens the path for a new creation of the universe, a new opportunity for the beauty and drama of universal illusion to unfold. Being Satyam, Shivam and Sundaram which denotes the Truth, Goodness and Beauty, Lord Shiva represents the essence of impeccable goodness and godliness. Shivaratri puja performed on the Festival called Maha Shivrartri invites the blessings of Lord Shiva and His divine consort, Goddess Parvati.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> #LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/trishul-third-eye-tattoo/">Trishul &#038; Third Eye Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lord Shiva is often portrayed as the supreme ascetic with a passive and composed disposition and that is what we wanted to capture in this particular tattoo. Although a very complicated deity, Shiva is one of the most fascinating of Hindu gods.</p><p>Shiva is &#8216;shakti&#8217; or power, Shiva is the destroyer, the most powerful god of the Hindu pantheon and one of the godheads in the Hindu Trinity. Known by many names &#8211; Mahadeva, Mahayogi, Pashupati, Nataraja, Bhairava, Vishwanath, Bhava, Bhole Nath &#8211; Lord Shiva is perhaps the most complex of Hindu deities. As body art, Lord Shiva designs can go anywhere on the body from your arm to your shoulder blade but giving the design a twist definitely makes it unique.</p><p>There is a reason Shiva is called &#8216;The Devo ke Dev-Mahadev&#8217;. The tranquil-looking lord can turn into a destroyer, and can also be a bholenath. He has multiple shades to his personality, and is one god who can truly teach us the wisdom to live life.</p><p>Lord Shiva was known as the destroyer of evil. He couldn&#8217;t tolerate injustice and destroyed the evil rakshasas in a fair manner. Similarly, even we should try to keep zero tolerance for the evil happening around us and take a stand against injustice.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> #LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/roaring-lord-shiva-tattoo/">Roaring Lord Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Lord Shiva as a Lingam</strong></p><p>Lord Shiva is worshipped in the form of the linga &#8211; some of which are jyotirlingas &#8211; at numerous places across India. The Linga, a sign of masculinity, symbolises Shiva’s role in the creation, sustainance and withdrawal of the Universe.</p><p><strong>The Avatars of Lord Shiva</strong></p><p>Lord Shiva, similar to Lord Vishnu, had many avatars. It was Virabhadra, an avatar of Lord Shiva, who disrupted Daksha’s yajna and cut off his head. His Bhairava avatar, also known as Kaal Bhairava, was created to protect the Sati Pind. His Durvasa avatar was famous for his short temper. Khandoba was another avatar of Shiva known in Maharashtrian and Kannada cultures. Finally, Hanuman avatar is known as the eleventh Rudraavtaar of Lord Shiva in the era of Lord Rama!</p><p><strong>Shiva The Multi-Faceted</strong></p><p>Lord Shiva is a god of ambiguity and paradox. He is depicted with an ambivalent nature when worshipped by the Hindus as their supreme God. He is mentioned in the Yajurveda as possessing both malignant and auspicious attributes. He is depicted in the Mahabharata as a figure of honour, delight, and brilliance. The Rudra form of Lord Shiva denotes “the wild one” or the fierce god. Yet, Shiva is also known as Sambhu, or the one who causes happiness.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong>&nbsp;#LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/radiant-lord-shiva-tattoo/">Radiant Lord Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

The necklace has 108 beads, which symbolize the elements used in the creation of the world.</p><p>Damaru (Drum): A small drum with two sides alienated from each other by a thin neck-like structure represents the two utterly different states of existence, unclear and clear. When a damaru is shaken, the sound formed denotes Nada, the cosmic sound of AUM, which can be heard during deep meditation.</p><p>Trishul (Trident): A three-branched trident shown adjoining Lord Shiva symbolizes His three fundamental powers will, action and knowledge. As a weapon, the trident represents the instrument of punishment to the evil doer on all three planes &#8211; spiritual, subtle, and physical.</p><p>Nandi, the Bull: Nandi is said to be the vehicle of Lord Shiva. The bull represents both power and ignorance.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Eye &amp; Skull Tattoo in Realistic Trash Polka Type Tattoo</strong></p><p>The term refers to tattoo subgenre Realism and to a music piece of Austrian musician Johann Strauss II called &#8220;Tritsch Tratsch Polka&#8221;, which the couple liked. Shortened in Trash Polka by the fans and disciples, it soon caught the eyes of the tattoo and art community with its bold, even violent style.<br>
Indeed, the genre is highly recognizable and is either loved or hated. Mixing both bold and fine black lines, grey shadings and dramatic touches of bright colors, mostly red, it looks more like a collage of various elements which, by all apparences, are not directly linked, and meaningless.</p><p>Realistic Trash Polka pieces often focus on realistic images, portraits coming from cinema, fashion and horror movies. Most of the pieces are showing beautiful ladies next to skulls. The perfection of those portraits contrasts with a chaotic composition, mixing blood or paint stains, drips, brush strokes and geometrical designs. Intertwined with the designs, are words, which look like letters cut from newspapers, or typewrited texts . The result is discordant yet aesthetically pleasing, reminding of the daring style of German contemporary graffiti art.</p><p>One thing to remember. Realistic Trash Polka is a trademark only Buena Vista Tattoo Club owns, but of course it didn’t prevent other artists to be inspired by the concept. First geographically limited to Eastern Europe but now spreading, even in Asia, you could always find someone to do a average copy of it. But of course, it doesn’t take only black and red ink to make real Trash Polka. It does need talent.‬</p><p>‪#‎3dtattoo‬ ‪#‎tatt‬ ‪#‎tatto‬ ‪#‎tatts‬ ‪#‎blackandgrey‬ ‪#‎bigtattoo‬ ‪#‎tattooonarm‬ ‪#‎tatted‬ ‪#‎tattooedguys‬ ‪#‎tattooedguysofinstagram‬ ‪#‎tattooideas‬ ‪#‎trashpolka‬ ‪#‎trash‬ ‪#‎tattoolovers‬ ‪#‎tattoomagazine‬ ‪#‎tattooartmagazine‬ ‪#‎tattoo‬ ‪#‎tattoos‬ ‪#‎tattooedmen‬ ‪#‎tattooist‬ ‪#‎tattooart‬ ‪#‎tattooartist‬ ‪#‎black‬ ‪#‎red‬ ‪#‎colortattoo‬</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/realistic-trash-polka-tattoo/">Realistic Trash Polka Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ancient Greek Warrior Helmet Tattoo &#8211; Inked By Black Poison Tattoos</strong></p><p>Enemies of the Leading Greek city states met instant defeat fighting again the near untouchable Spartan army. Their mastery of battle skills, warfare tactics and combat strength were virtually unsurpassed until the Battle of Leuctra.</p><p>At one point in time, the Spartans fared as not only the strongest but also most efficient warriors.</p><p>Thanks to the battle of Thermopylae against the Persians, their military prowess gained considerable fame. Perhaps you’ve seen the movie 300, which depicts 300 Spartan hoplites holding back an entire army.</p><p>Though not the end victor against the massive opposing forces, they still left behind a considerable lengthy trail of their enemies blood.</p><p>During battle, they were armed with the dory, which is a large spear, a chest plate, bronze cuirasses, leg grave and a helmet. Not to mention, these soldiers also carried a small sword for close combat.</p><p>Now, if that sounds like a considerable amount of gear, just remember that the Spartans also fought with a hoplite shield called the Aspis.</p><p>In terms of symbolism, you could attribute it to the pinnacle of being one of the most lethal and feared warriors. Unrivaled bravely, incredible sheer strength and stamina, and a relentless drive for victory paint their picture quite well.</p><p>Regardless of your interpretation or meaning, just about every man can respect the authority and power they once commanded. To help you visualize their battles, I’ve put together a guide of the top 50 best Spartan tattoo designs for men. You’ll discover masculine ideas and witness incredible acts of war!</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/ancient-greek-warrior-helmet-tattoo/">Warrior Helmet Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lord Hanuman Tattoo &amp; Its Meanings</p><p>Hanuman the Monkey God – Hanuman, known as the Monkey God, is the Indian deity with the biggest heart. Though his face and tail are that of a monkey, the body is human and covered with white hair. He is a symbol of devotion, not only of the heart, but to learning.</p><p><strong>I will get more tattoos ideas from this minimalist tattoos.</strong></p><p>His qualities of intelligence and inventiveness are said to be boundless, and no challenge in the world too difficult for him to handle. Employed as a symbol, Hanuman would inspire a person to use their power in the service of the greater good.</p><p>A highly respected character in Indian, Chinese, and Thai legend, Hanuman serves as a guard as well as a soldier of God. And to Muay Thai boxers in Thailand, the Hanuman tattoo represents strength, stamina and agility, all attributes of a champion fighter.</p><p>In Thailand, the Hanuman tattoo is considered an especially powerful one, and potentially harmful. Buddhist tattoo monks have traditionally applied protective designs to young men, but not before a discussion of what special protection is required.</p><p>Hanuman is not readily given out, because it’s said that the effects may be difficult to control. The power of each Thai spiritual tattoo is only released when activated with a spell upon the tattoo’s completion.</p><p>According to Indian mythology going back more than two thousand years, Hanuman was devoted to Lord Rama and his wife, Sita. In an act of ultimate loyalty, he tore his heart open to reveal that each of his beloveds lived within it.</p><p>Some Indian tribals believe that Hanuman himself was tattooed on one shoulder in order to relieve the pain each time it dislocated.</p><p>One legend tells of Hanuman aspiring to become a worthy student of Suriya, the sun deity. To prove his serious intent, Hanuman walked backwards in her presence rather than turn his back on her. As a mischievous child, he tormented the sages at their prayers, and was punished with a curse that caused him to forget he possessed great powers. When prevailed upon by those who needed his aid, however, his strengths returned full force.</p><p>The epic known as the Ramayana recounts Hanuman’s many heroic acts, including the rescue of Lord Rama’s wife, Sita. She had been abducted by King Ravana who held her hostage. So devoted was our monkey god that he allowed himself to be captured by Ravana’s troops so he might negotiate a settlement, and at the same time assess the king’s power and weakness.</p><p>When that ploy failed, he allowed himself to be recaptured, whereupon they set his tail ablaze. Hanuman confused his startled foes by growing his flaming tail longer and longer, and upon escaping, torched Ravana’s kingdom with his flaming tail.</p><p>Where did Hanuman get his monkey features? It depends on which of many versions of Indian scriptures you believe. In some stories, Hanuman was originally a god of the Wind who saved Lord Shiva’s kingdom – the Himalayas – from Ravana’s armies. The defeated king meant to be insulting when he called him a ‘monkey’, so Shiva honoured Hanuman’s heroics by manifesting himself with monkey features, and from then on Hanuman was considered to be a reflection of Shiva.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-hanuman-tattoo/">Lord Hanuman Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
