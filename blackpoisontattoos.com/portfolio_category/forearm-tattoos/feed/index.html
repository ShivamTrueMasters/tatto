										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the world of tattoo art, minimalism speaks volumes. The understated elegance of a minimalist tattoo often carries a deep, personal significance, and this is beautifully exemplified in designs that bring elements of nature to life. Among such tattoos, the combination of mountains, trees, and waves stands out as a poignant representation of the natural world’s serene and enduring beauty.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-symbolism-behind-the-elements">The Symbolism Behind the Elements</h4><p><strong>Mountains:</strong> A symbol of strength, resilience, and the enduring quality of nature, mountains in tattoos often represent the challenges we overcome in life. They remind us of our inner strength and the heights we strive to reach.</p><p><strong>Pine Trees:</strong> These evergreens are frequently depicted as symbols of eternal life, peace, and longevity. In tattoos, a pine tree can signify one’s love for the outdoors or a personality that stands resilient through all seasons of life.</p><p><strong>Waves:</strong> Often representing change and the ebb and flow of life’s experiences, waves symbolize both the calm and the turmoil in our lives. A wave in a tattoo can also express a deep connection to the sea and the contemplative nature it inspires.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-appeal-of-minimalist-designs">The Appeal of Minimalist Designs</h4><p>Minimalist tattoos are more than just a style; they are a statement of values. They reflect a preference for things that are straightforward yet profound. The clarity and simplicity of the design allow each element to shine on its own while contributing to a cohesive whole. This type of tattoo appeals to those who prefer subtlety in expression and profundity in meaning.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-choosing-the-right-design">Choosing the Right Design</h4><p>Opting for a minimalist tattoo like the one described requires consideration of placement, scale, and the artist&#8217;s ability to capture the essence of the design with clean, uncluttered lines. Such tattoos are versatile—they can adapt to any part of the body but are commonly chosen for visible areas like the forearm, where they remain a constant reminder of the values they symbolize.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-artist-s-touch">The Artist&#8217;s Touch</h4><p>The role of a skilled tattoo artist cannot be understated in the creation of minimalist designs. Precision in line work and an understanding of spacing and proportion are crucial to bring out the elegance and symbolism of each element. When choosing an artist, it’s important to review their portfolio for similar works and ensure their style aligns with your vision.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-reflection-of-personal-journey">A Reflection of Personal Journey</h4><p>For many, a tattoo is more than body art—it&#8217;s a milestone or a marker of a personal journey. This specific tattoo design encapsulates the wearer&#8217;s connection with nature and their personal resilience. It serves as a daily reminder of their strength, adaptability, and the peace they find in the natural world.</p><p>Tattoos are a profound way to express one’s philosophy, beliefs, and loves. A minimalist design like this one, while simple in form, is rich in meaning and an artistic testament to the complexities of human experiences interwoven with nature.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/nature-tattoos/">Discovering the Depth of Nature in Minimalist Tattoo Art</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is a Dragon Warrior Tattoo on the Forearm?</strong></p><p>A dragon warrior tattoo combines the mystical elements of dragons with the symbolic strength of a warrior, creating a unique and powerful design. Tattooed on the forearm, this art symbolizes bravery, resilience, and protection. The placement on the forearm makes it highly visible and an eye-catching display of personal strength and character.</p><p>In this post, we’ll explore the symbolism behind dragon warrior tattoos, design tips, and why the forearm is an ideal canvas for this style of body art.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-choose-a-dragon-warrior-tattoo">Why Choose a Dragon Warrior Tattoo?</h3><p>A dragon represents power, wisdom, and fierce protection, while a warrior embodies strength, courage, and the willingness to fight for one’s values. Together, these symbols create a powerful story that reflects the wearer’s personal journey or identity.</p><p>Here are some reasons people choose this design:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Strength and Resilience:</strong> Both dragons and warriors are enduring symbols of strength, often depicted overcoming challenges. This tattoo reflects inner resilience and an unyielding spirit.</li>

<li><strong>Protection and Guardianship:</strong> Dragons in many cultures are seen as protectors, while warriors are defenders. This tattoo can symbolize the desire to protect oneself or others.</li>

<li><strong>Mystical and Historical Appeal:</strong> The combination of mythological dragons and historical warriors adds a timeless, mystical element that resonates with fans of ancient folklore or history.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-designing-a-dragon-warrior-tattoo">Designing a Dragon Warrior Tattoo</h3><p>Designing the perfect dragon warrior tattoo requires attention to detail and personal symbolism. Here are some design tips:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Dragon and Warrior Style:</strong> You can go for traditional Eastern-style dragons, known for their long, serpentine bodies, or Western dragons, which are more reptilian with wings. As for warriors, think of medieval knights, samurai, or even Viking figures. Each has its own distinct feel.</li>

<li><strong>Forearm Placement:</strong> The forearm is a great place for elongated designs that wrap around or extend from wrist to elbow. This allows the dragon’s body to flow naturally, giving a dynamic appearance as you move.</li>

<li><strong>Detail and Color:</strong> Dragon tattoos often feature intricate scales, claws, and fire, while warriors showcase armor, weapons, and determined expressions. Using color can bring these elements to life, but black and gray shading can also create a strong, dramatic effect.</li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-forearm">Why the Forearm?</h3><p>The forearm is one of the most popular tattoo locations for a reason. Here’s why it’s perfect for a dragon warrior tattoo:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Visibility and Statement:</strong> Tattoos on the forearm are highly visible, allowing the wearer to proudly showcase their design. It’s a place where you can express your identity boldly.</li>

<li><strong>Pain Tolerance:</strong> Compared to other areas, the forearm is less painful for tattooing due to the thicker skin and muscle tissue. This makes it ideal for larger, more detailed designs.</li>

<li><strong>Movement and Flow:</strong> A tattoo on the forearm can seem almost alive when the arm moves. The dragon&#8217;s body or the warrior’s stance can appear to shift, adding a dynamic feel to the design.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tips-for-getting-a-dragon-warrior-tattoo">Tips for Getting a Dragon Warrior Tattoo</h3><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Research Artists:</strong> Find a tattoo artist who specializes in detailed work and mythological or fantasy designs. Their expertise will bring your vision to life.</li>

<li><strong>Consider the Long Term:</strong> Since forearm tattoos are visible, consider the long-term implications, especially if you work in a professional environment where visible tattoos might be a concern.</li>

<li><strong>Care and Maintenance:</strong> Keep your tattoo looking vibrant by following proper aftercare. The forearm gets a lot of exposure to sunlight, so regularly apply sunscreen to prevent fading.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3><p>A dragon warrior tattoo on the forearm is more than just body art; it’s a statement of strength, protection, and personal identity. Whether you choose an intricate black and gray design or a vibrant, colorful piece, this tattoo can serve as a powerful reminder of resilience and courage. If you’re ready to take on this bold design, find an experienced tattoo artist, and let your journey of ink begin.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/dragon-warrior-tattoo/">Dragon Warrior Tattoo on Forearm: Symbolism, Design, and Placement</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos are a deeply personal expression, and for many, they hold spiritual significance. One of the most awe-inspiring designs gaining popularity in the tattoo world is the fusion of <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong>, the <strong>Shivling</strong>, and <strong>Ram-Ram chants</strong>. This divine combination is not only visually powerful but also packed with spiritual symbolism, making it a meaningful choice for those looking to honor their faith and devotion.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll explore the significance of this fusion tattoo, what each element represents, and why it’s an amazing design choice for anyone looking to blend faith and art.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-symbolism-behind-each-element">The Symbolism Behind Each Element</h3><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-lord-hanuman">1. <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong></h4><p>Lord Hanuman, one of the most revered deities in Hinduism, is the epitome of strength, devotion, and loyalty. Known as the mighty monkey god, he played a pivotal role in the <strong>Ramayana</strong>, serving as Lord Rama’s most loyal devotee. Hanuman is also seen as the protector, someone who guards against evil forces. His inclusion in a tattoo is often a mark of protection, courage, and immense dedication to a higher power.</p><p>For those who look to embody his fearless spirit, strength, and unwavering devotion, a Hanuman tattoo is a powerful symbol. Many designs capture him in his most iconic form—holding a mountain or ripping open his chest to reveal Lord Rama and Sita inside, showcasing his deep devotion.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-shivling">2. <strong>Shivling</strong></h4><p>The <strong>Shivling</strong> represents the infinite power and energy of <strong>Lord Shiva</strong>, the destroyer of evil and transformer of the universe. It signifies the balance of creation and destruction, serving as a reminder of life’s cyclical nature. For many, the Shivling is a powerful representation of their connection to the universe and their desire to remain in harmony with nature.</p><p>In tattoo designs, the Shivling is often depicted with vibrant shading and intricate detail, symbolizing Lord Shiva’s cosmic energy. It pairs beautifully with Lord Hanuman, as Hanuman is often considered an incarnation or devotee of Lord Shiva, thus blending their energies in one stunning design.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-ram-ram-chants">3. <strong>Ram-Ram Chants</strong></h4><p>The repeated chanting of <strong>“Ram-Ram”</strong> holds a unique place in the hearts of Hindu devotees. Lord Rama is the epitome of virtue and righteousness, and the continuous chanting of his name is believed to purify the soul and bring peace. Ram-Ram chants are often used in prayers and meditation as a form of devotion and mindfulness.</p><p>In tattoo art, these chants can be incorporated into the design in beautiful flowing scripts. The <strong>Devanagari script</strong>, in particular, is favored for its traditional look and adds a sense of spiritual depth to the tattoo. The repetitive mantra not only reinforces one’s devotion to Lord Rama but also serves as a constant reminder of inner peace and moral guidance.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-fusion-tattoo-is-powerful">Why This Fusion Tattoo is Powerful</h3><p>Combining <strong>Lord Hanuman, the Shivling, and Ram-Ram chants</strong> into a single tattoo creates a multi-dimensional piece of art that carries deep personal and spiritual meaning. Here&#8217;s why it&#8217;s such a compelling design:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Spiritual Significance</strong> – Each element carries its weight of devotion, protection, and divine energy. Together, they create a strong visual and spiritual statement about the wearer’s faith.</li>

<li><strong>Personalized Design</strong> – The fusion of these elements allows for a highly customized tattoo, as each aspect can be styled according to personal preferences—whether that’s focusing more on Hanuman’s features or highlighting the flow of the chants around the Shivling.</li>

<li><strong>Symbol of Protection and Strength</strong> – Hanuman’s presence symbolizes strength and loyalty, while the Shivling adds the element of cosmic energy and divine balance. The Ram-Ram chants tie the design together as a spiritual shield, protecting the wearer from negativity and evil forces.</li>

<li><strong>Cultural Reverence</strong> – These symbols represent key deities and beliefs in Hinduism, making the tattoo a form of cultural homage. It connects the wearer to their roots and serves as a visual reminder of their spiritual journey.</li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-design-inspirations-and-ideas">Design Inspirations and Ideas</h3><p>If you’re considering getting this fusion tattoo, there are several creative ways to bring these elements together:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Backpiece Masterpiece</strong>: One popular approach is to make this tattoo a large backpiece, with Hanuman as the central figure, the Shivling below, and the Ram-Ram chants flowing around them. This style allows for detailed artistry and can convey a full narrative of devotion.</li>

<li><strong>Forearm or Sleeve Design</strong>: For those looking for a smaller or more compact version, a forearm tattoo can focus on Hanuman’s face, with the Shivling subtly incorporated and the Ram-Ram chants woven into the background. This design maintains clarity while using space efficiently.</li>

<li><strong>Minimalist Fusion</strong>: A minimalist approach could include a small Shivling with Hanuman’s face in silhouette form, with Ram-Ram chants delicately scripted around it. This design is ideal for those wanting a more subtle but deeply meaningful tattoo.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-key-considerations">Key Considerations</h3><p>When getting this tattoo, remember to:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Choose the Right Artist</strong>: Make sure your tattoo artist has experience with intricate designs and understands the spiritual significance behind these elements. You want the symbols to be respected and accurately depicted.</li>

<li><strong>Placement Matters</strong>: The placement of this tattoo can impact its visibility and size. Consider where you want to display this personal piece of art—whether on a more private part of the body or prominently where others can admire it.</li>

<li><strong>Customization</strong>: Don’t be afraid to tweak the design to make it personal to you. Whether you want a more modern take on the Shivling or a detailed portrait of Hanuman, the design can be tailored to fit your vision.</li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3><p>A fusion tattoo of <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong>, the <strong>Shivling</strong>, and <strong>Ram-Ram chants</strong> is not just a body art choice; it’s a spiritual journey etched into your skin. This design is a beautiful homage to Hindu deities, encapsulating strength, protection, and devotion. Whether you&#8217;re deeply religious or simply admire the cultural significance, this tattoo can be a meaningful and visually stunning addition to your body art collection.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/the-ultimate-fusion-tattoo-lord-hanuman-shivling-and-ram-ram-chants/">The Ultimate Fusion Tattoo: Lord Hanuman, Shivling, and Ram-Ram Chants</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of tattoos is brimming with symbolism and personal expression. Among the most captivating designs are those featuring wolves and women, a combination that exudes an air of haunting harmony.</p><p>The wolf, a powerful predator revered for its intelligence and loyalty, has long been a source of fascination in mythology and folklore. Often depicted as a guardian or spirit guide, the wolf embodies strength, independence, and a deep connection to the wild.</p><p>Women, on the other hand, represent the very essence of creation, nurturing, and intuition. Their portrayal in tattoos can encompass a wide spectrum, from the fierce and powerful to the enigmatic and mysterious.</p><p>When these two powerful symbols come together, they create a captivating fusion. The wolf&#8217;s untamed spirit juxtaposed with the woman&#8217;s enigmatic allure results in a tattoo that is both beautiful and thought-provoking.</p><p><strong>Delving Deeper: Meanings and Variations</strong></p><p>The specific meaning of a wolf and woman tattoo will depend on the individual&#8217;s interpretation and the design elements incorporated.

<li><strong>Connection to Nature:</strong>&nbsp;The wolf&#8217;s wild nature and the woman&#8217;s connection to the creative force represent a deep bond with the natural world.</li>

<li><strong>Wild Woman Archetype:</strong>&nbsp;The image can embody the untamed, instinctive side of femininity.</li></ul><p>The variations in design are endless. Some popular choices include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Realistic portrayals:</strong>&nbsp;Detailed renderings of wolves and women create a striking and powerful image.</li>

<li><strong>Watercolor style:</strong>&nbsp;Soft, flowing watercolors lend a dreamlike quality to the design.</li>

Consider what resonates most with you. What aspects of the wolf and the woman do you want to represent?

Introduction</h2><p>Have you ever gazed upon the image of a female devotee of Lord Shiva, holding the sacred damru in her hand? It&#8217;s a sight that not only captures the eye but also stirs the soul. In this article, we delve into the enchanting world of spirituality, symbolism, and devotion, as we explore the profound connection between a female devotee of Lord Shiva and the rhythmic beat of the damru.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-the-symbolism-of-lord-shiva-and-damru">2.

The damru, a small hourglass-shaped drum, is an extension of his rhythm. With every beat, it signifies the pulse of existence—the beginning and end of life&#8217;s cycles. In the hands of a female devotee, the damru takes on new meaning. It embodies the duality of life—gentleness and strength, creation and destruction—much like a woman&#8217;s multifaceted nature.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-embracing-the-feminine-divine">3.

The damru&#8217;s dual-sided nature—the balance of creation and destruction—mirrors life&#8217;s challenges and triumphs. In the hands of a female devotee, the damru becomes a source of strength, reminding her to find equilibrium amidst chaos and to embrace every phase of life with grace.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-channeling-energy-through-devotion">7.

This shared heartbeat transcends words, creating a profound communion.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-the-meditative-power-of-damru-s-sound">8.

Consider incorporating the Devanagari script for an authentic touch.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-symbolism-amp-imagery"><strong>Symbolism &amp; Imagery:</strong></h4><p>Weave in symbolic elements to add depth to your tattoo.

<li><strong>Wrist:</strong> A constant reminder on your sleeve, a silent expression of gratitude.</li>

<li><strong>Ankle:</strong> A more subtle placement, a personal tribute you hold close.</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-making-it-permanent"><strong>Making it Permanent:</strong></h4><p>Choosing the right tattoo artist is crucial. Look for someone experienced with script tattoos and a style that resonates with you. Discuss your design ideas, placement options, and aftercare instructions thoroughly.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-the-ink"><strong>Beyond the Ink:</strong></h4><p>A Maa Paa tattoo is more than just a decorative piece of body art. It&#8217;s a constant reminder of the love and sacrifices your parents have made for you.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos have been used as a form of self-expression and body art for centuries, with different designs symbolizing various meanings. One such popular design is the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe. This design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also holds significant meaning for those who choose to ink it onto their skin. In this blog post, we will explore the history, symbolism, and variations of the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">History of Compass and Anchor Tattoo on the Globe</h2><p>The compass and anchor tattoo on the globe has a rich history that dates back to the maritime era. It was a common tattoo design among sailors, who would often get inked with it as a symbol of their travels and adventures. The compass represents direction, guidance, and exploration, while the anchor represents stability, strength, and grounding. Combining these two symbols with the globe creates a tattoo design that represents a sense of worldly adventure, a desire for exploration, and the need for grounding and stability.</p><p>As maritime culture spread, so did the popularity of the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe. It soon became a common design among non-sailors as well, and today it is one of the most popular tattoo designs across the globe.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Symbolism of Compass and Anchor Tattoo on the Globe</h2><p>The compass and anchor tattoo on the globe holds significant symbolism and meaning for those who choose to get inked with it. The compass represents a sense of direction and guidance, reminding the wearer to stay focused on their goals and aspirations. It also symbolizes a desire for adventure and exploration, encouraging the wearer to step out of their comfort zone and explore new horizons.</p><p>The anchor, on the other hand, represents stability and grounding. It serves as a reminder that no matter how far we may wander, we always have a place to call home. The anchor also represents strength, reminding us that we have the inner strength to weather any storm that comes our way.</p><p>When combined with the globe, the compass and anchor tattoo takes on a new level of meaning. It represents a sense of wanderlust and a desire to explore the world, while also acknowledging the importance of staying grounded and connected to our roots.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-variations-of-compass-and-anchor-tattoo-on-the-globe">Variations of Compass and Anchor Tattoo on the Globe</h2><p>While the basic design of the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe remains the same, there are many variations that allow individuals to personalize their tattoos to suit their individual styles and preferences. Some people opt for a minimalist design, featuring a small compass and an anchor on a simple outline of the globe. Others choose a more elaborate design, incorporating intricate details and shading to create a more realistic representation of the globe.</p><p>The placement of the tattoo can also vary, with some people choosing to ink it on their forearm or wrist for easy visibility, while others opt for a more private placement on their chest or back. The size of the tattoo can also vary, with some people choosing a small, subtle design, while others opt for a larger, more prominent tattoo.</p><p>While tattoos have been around for centuries, the popularity and acceptance of tattoos have grown significantly in recent years. Today, tattoos are not only a form of self-expression but also a way to showcase personal beliefs, experiences, and values. Whether you&#8217;re considering getting a compass and anchor tattoo on the globe or any other tattoo design, it&#8217;s essential to understand the symbolism and meaning behind it.</p><p>Ultimately, a tattoo is a personal choice, and the design you choose should reflect your individuality and values. Tattoos are a lifelong commitment, so it&#8217;s essential to carefully consider the design, placement, and meaning behind your tattoo before getting inked. Whether you choose a simple, minimalist design or an elaborate, intricate tattoo, your ink should be a reflection of who you are and what you stand for.</p><p>In conclusion, the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe is a popular design with significant meaning and symbolism. Its history, culture, and symbolism continue to inspire many individuals to get inked with this design. Whether you&#8217;re a sailor or simply someone who loves to travel and explore the world, the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe is a beautiful way to showcase your love for adventure and groundedness.</p><p>If you&#8217;re interested in getting a compass and anchor tattoo on the globe, it&#8217;s essential to do your research and find a reputable tattoo artist. Look for an artist who specializes in the style of tattoo you&#8217;re interested in and has a portfolio of similar designs. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask questions, discuss your ideas with the artist, and make sure you feel comfortable before getting inked.</p><p>Once you have your tattoo, take proper care of it to ensure it heals properly and lasts a lifetime. Follow your artist&#8217;s aftercare instructions, avoid exposing the tattoo to direct sunlight or chlorine, and keep it moisturized with a gentle, fragrance-free lotion.</p><p>Getting a tattoo is a personal choice, and the meaning behind your tattoo can be as unique and individual as you are. The compass and anchor tattoo on the globe is a beautiful way to showcase your love for adventure, exploration, and groundedness, but it&#8217;s important to choose a design that resonates with you personally. Whether you choose a traditional design or a modern interpretation, your tattoo should be a reflection of who you are and what you stand for.</p><p>In summary, the compass and anchor tattoo on the globe is a popular and meaningful tattoo design with a rich history and symbolism. Whether you&#8217;re a sailor, traveller, or simply someone who loves adventure, this tattoo is a beautiful way to showcase your wanderlust and groundedness. If you&#8217;re considering getting inked with this design, take the time to research and find a reputable tattoo artist, and choose a design that truly speaks to you.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/compass-and-anchor-tattoo/">Compass &amp; Anchor Tattoo on the Globe: Symbolism, Meaning, and Significance</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feather tattoos are popular tattoo designs. There are many people who love to get feather tattoos on their bodies. You can draw a feather tattoo on your arm, back, and almost any part of your body. Feathers have different meanings like freedom, transition, etc. Also, the colour of the feather means something too. Also, some people choose to add a quote or any word with their feather tattoo design which makes it more meaningful</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">All important things you should know about feather tattoos</h2><p>Feather tattoos are one of the most popular tattoo designs. They are among the most versatile and can be drawn in multiple styles. Here are a few things you should know about feather tattoos:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-symbolism-of-feathers">Symbolism of Feathers</h3><p>Feathers have been used as symbols throughout history. They were used by Native Americans in ceremonies and rituals, while other cultures used feathers to symbolize good luck, courage, or love.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing a Feather Tattoo Design</h3><p>Feathers are a beautiful way to express yourself with your body art. If you&#8217;re looking for something unique that expresses your personality, then consider getting a feather tattoo!</p><p>Feather tattoos are versatile and express different messages depending on the colors and designs used. Feathers are often used in Native American culture to represent the link between the bird and the spirit world. The feather symbolizes a connection to higher power, freedom, strength, and peace.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">History of Feather Tattoo Designs</h3><p>Feathers also have historical significance in many cultures as symbols of honor or prestige; for example, tribal leaders wear feathers as a sign of their position in society.</p><p>The image of wings has been used by many cultures throughout history including Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans who associated it with divine creation through both Hermes (winged messenger god) but also Jesus Christ (the winged man).</p><p>Feathers are a common symbol of freedom, flight, and transition. They&#8217;re also associated with peace and death—but only after life&#8217;s transition has occurred. Feathers can be symbolic of rebirth as well because they represent new life emerging from old ones.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Meaning of Feather Tattoo Design</h3><p>This may not seem like much when you look at it on its own; however, if you consider the last few weeks in your own life (or even if you just think back to some random day), then this meaning makes more sense. Every time our lives change direction or we move on to another phase of our existence (like getting out of school or graduating), we experience something similar to what birds do when they shed their feathers each year: they grow new ones so they can fly.</p><p>We all like to feel that our tattoos are meaningful, but most of the time they just look cool. But if you want something that really resonates with your life, adding a quote or other word is a great way to do it.</p><p>If you’re going to put words on your body for life, make sure those words matter! It doesn’t have to be Shakespeare or some other famous poet—it could be lyrics from a song that reminds you of someone special or describes how you feel about yourself. Or maybe even just a phrase from an old book that has stuck with you over the years.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Design &amp; Location of Feather Tattoos</h3><p>Feather tattoos are versatile and express different messages depending on the colors and designs used. They can be designed in a variety of styles, from realistic to abstract, and in multiple locations on the body. In addition to feathers, you can incorporate winged animals like birds or angels into your design for an added level of meaning.</p><p>Feathers can also be designed with vibrant colors like red and yellow that traditionally represent passion or fire, making them perfect for those looking for a bold statement piece!</p><p>We have discussed different types of feather tattoos. There are many different designs for this tattoo. You can choose any one of them depending on your personality and the meaning behind the design. If you want to get a tattoo with feathers then first think about what it means to you, then choose a design that suits your personality type, and finally find a good artist who will create your dream tattoo.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/cute-feather-tattoo-on-the-forearm/">Cute feather tattoo on the forearm</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>These are the best bee tattoos that you can get!</strong></p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-honey-bumble-queen-africanized-carpenter-leopard-print-cute-little-small-baby-cartoon-bee-tattoo-guide">Your Honey, Bumble, Queen, Africanized, Carpenter, Leopard Print, Cute little small baby cartoon bee tattoo guide.</h4><p>If you’re looking for a cute small baby cartoon bee tattoo design, this guide is for you!</p><p>In this article, we are going to cover all kinds of bees. You’ll get an Africanized bee tattoo and Bumble Bee Tattoo. As well as:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Honey Bee Tattoo</li><li>Queen Bee Tattoo</li><li>Carpenter Bee Tattoo</li><li>Leopard Print Bee Tattoo</li><li>Cute Small Baby Cartoon Bee Design</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-honey-bee-tattoo">Honey Bee Tattoo</h4><p>If you&#8217;re looking to get a sweet honey bee tattoo, check out the following meanings and designs.</p><p>Honey Bee Tattoo Meaning:</p><p>Honey bees are associated with many positive things like beauty, fertility, and abundance. They may symbolize love or even motherhood.</p><p>Honey Bee Tattoo Designs:</p><p>These can be found in various shapes such as butterflies, birds, and flowers as well as words like “hope” or “sweetheart”! The most popular choice seems to be flower arrangements with yellow and white petals representing honeycomb cells containing pollen from flowers that bees pollinate during springtime when flowers are blooming in abundance across North America (and elsewhere).</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bumble-bee-tattoo">Bumble Bee Tattoo</h4><p>Bumble bee tattoos are quite popular among women because they represent a sense of freedom, beauty, and power. These tiny insects are not aggressive by nature, and as a result, their tattoo designs tend to be cute and soft. The symbol of bees is also associated with creativity and fertility, so many people choose this design to enhance the feminine energy in their lives.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bumble-bee-tattoo-designs">Bumble Bee Tattoo Designs</h4><p>There are many different ways you can design your bumble bee tattoo. Here are some examples:</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-queen-bee-tattoo">Queen Bee Tattoo</h4><p>If you’re looking for a bee tattoo, you may be wondering what type of bee to get. There are many different kinds of bees out there, each with its own set of characteristics and jobs to do. A queen bee tattoo is one of the most popular designs because it’s simple and easy to recognize &#8211; the queen is usually depicted as being larger than other honeybees in her hive, and she has two sets of wings!</p><p>While many tattoos feature images of just any old bee or even an entire colony, queen bee tattoos are designed to look like a specific kind: specifically, they show an actual queen honeybee in flight. Because this species is so large compared with other insects (including worker bees), it stands out from the crowd when depicted on skin.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-africanized-bee-tattoo">Africanized Bee Tattoo</h4><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Africanized bees are significantly more aggressive than European honey bees. They will attack people who get too close to their hives, and they&#8217;re also more likely to sting someone who accidentally disturbs them.</li><li>Africanized bees are more likely to swarm than European honey bees. Swarming is when a colony of bees leaves its hive in search of a new location, sometimes in huge numbers (hundreds of thousands).</li><li>Africanized bees are more likely to chase someone away from the area around their hive, whereas European honey bee colonies tend not to do this in general (though they may chase if they feel threatened).</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-carpenter-bee-tattoo">Carpenter Bee Tattoo</h4><p>A large, black insect could be a carpenter bee. Carpenter bees are black and yellow and can be as big as a bumblebee. They have large, hairy eyes and an abdomen that’s mostly black, but with bright yellow markings on their thoraxes (the middle section of their bodies). Females have longer abdomens than males do.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leopard-print-bee-tattoo">Leopard Print Bee Tattoo</h4><p>If you are looking for the best example of a leopard print bee tattoo then look no further. The design is unique, bold, and beautiful. It&#8217;s a perfect example of how to make your own statement with this type of tattoo. The artist has created a stunning piece that has been done so well that it almost looks as if it&#8217;s made from flowers instead of ink.</p><p>This particular design is based on the Africanized honey bee which originated in Brazil but was later introduced into other countries around the world such as North America where they now thrive today due to their ability to survive environments that would normally be unsuitable for them because of climate change such as deserts where temperatures can reach up over 40°C during summer months (or “hot spells” as Americans call them).</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cute-bee-tattoo">Cute Bee Tattoo</h4><p>When you think of a tattoo, you might be imagining a large piece of art that takes up your entire back. However, there are many smaller tattoos &#8211; meaning those that fit on a small part of the body &#8211; that can be just as impactful.</p><p>Here are some tips for choosing and placing a small bee tattoo:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Think about the area of your body where you want to place this tattoo. You&#8217;ll want to consider whether or not it will be visible through clothing and if it will look good when layered with other tattoos.</li><li>Select an artist based on their portfolio and reputation for creating small tattoos like bees.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">The significance<b> of Crescent Moon on Lord Shiva’s Head</b></a></p><p>Shiva Tattva is where there is no mind and the moon signifies the mind. When there is no mind then how can this ‘no-mindedness’ be expressed and how can anybody understand it? You need a little bit of the mind to understand, experience and to express.</p><p>The no-mind, infinite consciousness requires that little bit of mind to express itself in the manifest world. So, to express that inexpressible, that little mind (crescent moon) is on the head.<br>Wisdom is beyond the mind, but it needs to be expressed with a tinge of mind and this is symbolized by the crescent moon.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Damru</strong></b></p><p><b>Damru</b>&nbsp;symbolizes the Universe which is always expanding and collapsing. From an expansion it collapses and then it re-expands, this is the process of creation.<br>If you see your heartbeat, it is not just one straight line but it is a rhythm that goes up and down. The whole world is nothing but rhythms; energy rising and collapsing to rise again. So the&nbsp;damru&nbsp;signifies that. Look at the shape of the&nbsp;damru, from expansion it collapses and again expands.</p><p>Lord shiva tattoo &#8211; The darmru is also a symbol of sound. Sound is rhythm and sound is energy. The whole universe is nothing but a wave function, it is nothing but rhythms. What does quantum physics say? It says the same thing – the whole universe is nothing but rhythms. It is just one wave (Adviata). So the damru signifies the non-dual nature of the universe.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Serpent around Lord Shiva’s Neck</strong></b></p><p>A state of samadhi where there is nothing, just the inner sky of consciousness, is Shiva; where there is alertness and no action. To describe this alertness they put a snake around Shiva’s neck. So the&nbsp;<b>serpent</b>&nbsp;is a symbol of&nbsp;<b>alertness</b>.</p><p>In the state of meditation when the eyes are closed, it gives the impression that the person is sleeping, but he is not asleep, he is alert. To express this state of consciousness, a&nbsp;<b>snake</b>&nbsp;is shown around Lord Shiva’s neck.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Trishul (Trident)-Lord shiva tattoo</strong></b></p><p><b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;represents the three aspects of consciousness – waking, dreaming and sleeping, and it represents the three&nbsp;gunas – satva, rajas&nbsp;and&nbsp;tamas. Holding a&nbsp;trishul&nbsp;(Trident) signifies that Shiva (the divinity) is above all the three states – waking, dreaming and sleeping, yet is the upholder of these three states.<br>The divinity is beyond the three gunas, but it holds the three&nbsp;gunas&nbsp;together.</p><p><b>Shul</b>&nbsp;means problems or suffering.&nbsp;<b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;means that which destroys all kind of suffering.<br>Three types of pain that arise in life:<br>1.&nbsp;Aadibhautik&nbsp;(physical)<br>2.&nbsp;Aadhyaatmik&nbsp;(spiritual) and<br>3.&nbsp;Aadidaivik&nbsp;(ethereal)<br>What relieves you from all the problems and suffering is the&nbsp;trishul. And it is in the hand of Shiva.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/shiva-shakti-tattoo/">Shiva Shakti Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

They are mainly worn by men, but some women may like them as well.</strong></a></p><p>Scorpions are among the most dangerous creatures on Earth.

Scorpion tattoos are popular for both men and women.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-black-scorpion">The Black Scorpion</h4><p>The black scorpion tattoo design has been used by people for centuries. It&#8217;s one of the oldest symbols known to man. This symbol represents strength, power, and protection.</p><p>A scorpion tattoo represents the traits and attributes of the scorpion. Someone who gets this arachnid tatted on their body might want to send the message that they are deadly, stealthy, and not to be messed with. In addition to representing the scorpion&#8217;s characteristics, this tat could also be a symbol of a variety of other meanings, such as the zodiac sign Scorpio.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">scorpion and rose tattoo</a> represents two living things that are not to be judged by their covers. The scorpion is small, yet intimidating, and the rose is beautiful but can hurt someone with its thorns. Both the scorpion and the rose should be admired from a distance. Getting a tattoo with a scorpion and rose means that you are someone. Who cannot be judged and that people should be wary when trying to get close to you. Either physically or spiritually. A scorpion with a rose tail could mean that you are a double-edged sword. You can sting, but you can also be pleasant.</p><p>Scorpion and rose tattoos convey to others that living things should not be judged by their appearances. Even though both are very beautiful, both the scorpion and the rose can bring about great pain and should be admired from afar. Those with scorpions and roses tattooed on their body send a message to others that it may be difficult to get emotionally or physically too close to them.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/scorpio-tattoo/">Best Scorpion Tattoo Design of All Time</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palms-together is beautiful in religion.We close eyes during prayer is to quiet the mind while two hands placed together is to quiet the physical body. I remember there is a sentence is “When the mind and hands are silenced the spirit is more focused”. There are many different meanings staying inside each tattoo. We have it to commemorate a member of the family, a relative, a friend or a person you admire who passed away. We have it to mark and raise ourselves up in hard periods in our life. Sometimes, we have it to just praying for the happiness and the health of our family. In general, the religious belief and comfort are what people aim in life.</p><p>God gave a gift to the world when you were born&#8230;Praying Hands In God&#8217;s hands lies a heart, a life that changed the world&nbsp;<strong>Praying hands symbolize obedience, submission, sincerity, repentance, veneration, and respect in regard to one&#8217;s higher power.</strong> The exact meaning of praying hands varies depending on which religious tradition is considered.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><strong>Praying hands tattoos Design Variations of the Tattoo</strong></a></p><p>The praying hands tattoo works well alone. But many people like to stylize the image to their own artistic likes and dislikes. As well as their own beliefs.</p><p>There are hundreds of reasons why people have a tattoo such as falling in love, separating in love. Having religion, showing personality and so on. Coming to the market of tattoos today, you will be shocked by its diversity and you as well will be easy to take a fancy to own one. If you really want to take it and you are pious, praying hands tattoo may be a good choice for you. In the world of religious tattoos, this one is sparkling like a star.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/"><strong>The koi fish is a symbol with extremely deep meaning for those who choose it as part of their body art. </strong></a></p><p>If you have been considering getting a tattoo that involves a koi fish, take the time first to learn the meaning associated with them. The traditional significance of a koi fish tattoo can vary depending on the fish’s orientation (whether it is going up or down your body) and color. You want to be sure that your koi fish tattoo conveys the desired meaning.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">Koi fish Tattoos</a> are prominent in the work of Japanese tattoo artists because of a long-standing legend of how the fish become dragons. Most of the meaning and symbolism behind the fish stems from this ancient legend. Beliefs about the meaning and direction a koi fish is swimming in vary greatly. Some theories of what it means are actually contradictory. But, if you are using a koi in your tattoo, you can choose the meaning that applies to you. Tattoos are your form of self-expression.</p><p>Koi fish are capable of adapting to many different climates and water conditions and can symbolize strength. It is inherent in a koi&#8217;s nature to swim upstream. Through the koi fish legend, you can see that they show great determination, dedication, perseverance, and success.</p><p>The black koi is associated with successfully overcoming an obstacle. This symbol is great for those who have gone through a tough battle in life and have finally made it to a place of strength. These obstacles can include depression, drug addiction, an abusive relationship, and many other situations.</p><p>Koi fish tattoos often incorporate various symbols, such as the yin-yang symbol, water, and fire, dragons, or lotus flowers.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/koi-fish-tattoo/">Koi Fish Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

In a Sikh Jat family on 28 September 1907 in Lyallpur, Punjab in British India. His family had earlier involved in revolutionary activities against the British Raj.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">His uncle Swaran Singh had participated in the freedom struggle against the British.</a> When in 1907, another uncle of Bhagat. Ajit Singh was arrested and exiled to Rangoon in Burma (Myanmar), Swaran asked the people of Punjab to force the government for his release and due to his efforts, Ajit Singh was released from Rangoon jail in October 1907.</p><p>After coming back from jail, Ajit Singh decided to start a major revolt against the British. He began agitating the farmers and peasants to start a movement against them.</p><p>The British came to know of his intentions arrested him on 13 January 1911, when he was attending the Lohri festival celebration at his relative&#8217;s house. In February, Ajit Singh escaped from jail and ran away home, only to inform about his planning to start a mass struggle abroad in India.

At 2 pm as the boy Bhagat entered the bagh&#8217;s compound he saw blood scattered all over the ground. The turbans and torn clothes of people laid lifeless on the ground. The walls of the compound were red with blood. As it was a curfew in Punjab those days, the blood hadn&#8217;t been cleaned. Bhagat had taken a glass bottle with him before leaving from home. He took a handful of blood-stained soil and put it in the bottle. He reached home and put the bottle on in front of the Sikh gurus portrait and prayed to him for peace and solace for the victims of the massacre and he pledged to teach the British a lesson.</p><p>In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-cooperation movement to encourage a mass protest against the British and to boycott their trade in India, and to end their cooperation with British rule. Many people joined the movement and discarded the use of foreign goods and clothes. The people boycotted schools and colleges. The factories, industries, shops &amp; hospitals run by the government were all boycotted.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The intricacy and abstract nature of Polynesian armband tattoo have led to their continued popularity for hundreds of years. They are some of the most varied and eye-catching designs available anywhere in the world, and they have such a wide spectrum of meanings that just about anyone can find a tribal armband tattoo that fits with their life.</p><p><strong>Tiki</strong></p><p>Tiki is a human-like figure that represents Polynesian semi-gods, which means deified ancestors and heads, who are sublimed after their death. According to its guardian role, they mainly symbolize protection. If you love playing pc games, you’ll find that in many lost temples, Tiki patterns are often carved on pillars or stone gate.</p><p>Tiki plays a very important role in Polynesian culture. For example, nose symbols mean sniffing danger before its coming. Tiki’s eyes, nose, mouth and side faces are all important design elements and most Polynesian tattoo designs contain one or more tiki symbols.</p><p><strong>Sea Shell</strong></p><p>In Polynesian tattoo designs, shells are very common in many designs, especially turtle shells. Turtle shell is a symbolization of turtle, which is a very important sea creature in all the cultures of the Polynesian triangle. It has more meanings than other symbols. Some complex turtle designs could have quite a lot of meanings, according to its elements embedded in. Basically, turtle shells symbolize longevity, wellness, fertility, and peace</p><p><strong>Shark Teeth</strong></p><p>Shark teeth are another fish symbol which is very popular among Polynesian tattoo fans.&nbsp; Nearly over 50% of Polynesian tattoo designs have shark teeth symbols embedded in.</p><p>Shark teeth usually represent shelter or coverage, guidance, power, ferocity, adaptability, etc. In Polynesian legend, sharks also represent the god of Polynesian people.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meaning of the gladiator tattoo for men is quite obvious, and it is known to every young man who once watched the eponymous film with Russell Crowe. The word itself derives from the Latin word “gladius”, which is translated as “sword”.</p><p>In those distant times, gladiators were enslaved people, slaves or soldiers and criminals taken prisoners during the battles.

Over time, they began to hold such battles for entertainment without much reason. The Romans borrowed offering up sacrifices in the form of gladiatorial games from the Egyptians, Etruscans, and Greeks.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The History of the Dove Symbol</strong></p><p>The dove ranks as one of the most widely-known symbols around the world, universally representing peace and love. Due to the symbol’s wide recognition, these tattoos are popular all around the globe.</p><p><strong>The dove embodies a variety of positive meanings.</strong></p><p><strong>Enduring Love</strong>. Because doves mate with one partner for the duration of their lives and also take care of their young together, they represent steadfast love and devotion. The bond between the mated pair is a lifelong, enduring, and faithful partnership.</p><p><strong>Mythological Significance</strong>. The dove is also mentioned in Greek and Roman mythology: the Greek goddess Aphrodite, the goddess of love and fertility, was said to ride in a chariot borne by doves. Her seven daughters (known as the Pleiades) are referred to as a flock of doves in Greek mythology. Some tribes believed that the spirits of the dead are transformed into doves. Some American Indians may use the dove tattoo to represent this association.</p><p><strong>Dove and Rose Tattoo</strong></p><p><strong>Peace and Harmony.</strong>&nbsp;Since early Christianity, the dove holding an olive branch in its beak has represented a symbol of peace. Ironically, the image of a dove holding a grenade has become quite popular as well.</p><p><strong>Holy Spirit.</strong>&nbsp;The dove is commonly associated with Jesus and Christianity. Many examples of Christian art depict Jesus accompanied by a flock of doves. Doves are mentioned often in the Bible, for example in the story of Noah&#8217;s Ark. Before the great flood, God ordered Noah to build a ark for him and his family and to gather all the animals in pairs, one male and one female. God then flooded the earth and everything was destroyed. After several weeks at sea, Noah sent out a dove and a raven to look for signs of land.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More popularly known in Asian cultures such as in Japan, cherry blossoms have various meanings. They have become a national symbol for the country and they have been known to be celebrating amazing cherry blossom festivals all throughout spring. Not only does the flower have national symbolism it also has cultural impact as well. Primarily it is believed to be a symbol of joy and love; it also helps strengthen the spirit and promotes the beauty of life. Cherry blossoms only bloom in spring and they disappear again after a short time which symbolizes how people should value and appreciate life as it lasts.</p><p>The Japanese cherry blossom is interpreted as &#8216;transient of life&#8217;, since it is very fragile and has a short blooming period. There is an old story attached to this tree that values sacrifice. It is said that there is a&nbsp;<i>Jiu-roku-zakura</i>(the Cherry tree of the Sixteenth day), in the Iyo district of the country. This tree grew on the lands of a Samurai for over a hundred years. When the Samurai became old, the tree began to die. The Samurai felt really bad for the tree. He was a brave and honorable man. Hence, he thought up of a way to save the tree&#8217;s life.</p><p>He sat under the tree and committed a ritual suicide right there. This act gave the essence of the Samurai&#8217;s life to the tree. Within one hour of the Samurai&#8217;s death, on the 16th day of the month. The tree began to blossom and continues to live even today. Hence, the cherry blossom tree harbors many spiritual beliefs. These beliefs are set deep within the fundamental teachings of the Buddha.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/cherry-blossom-flower-tattoo/">Cherry Blossom Flower Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A child, a brother, a charioteer, a warrior, a disciple, a guru, a cowherd, a messenger, the beloved of the gopis… Throughout his life, Krishna enacted so many roles—the whole time never forgetting. That they were just that, roles, and that his true nature was eternal, ever blissful consciousness. In this way, he was able to remain detached and thus perform flawlessly, never allowing the smile to fall from his face.</p><p><strong>“There have been very few who have been able to rejoice both in victory and in defeat,”</strong></p><p>Amma says. “Sri Krishna is one who celebrated both life and death. That is why he was always able to give a big smile.</p><p>He took birth with a smile on his face, lived with a smile, and left his body with a smile. The message that he conveyed through his life is that we should make life full of laughter.”</p><p>Krishna’s life was so full, it would be impossible to recount it all here. It is told primarily through Srimad Bhagavatam, Garga Samhita, Visnu Purana, Brahmavaivarta Purana, Mahabharata, Harivamsa and several other Puranas. However, here are some of the broad strokes.</p><p>Krishna, in fact, took birth in a prison cell. A sage had told his egoistic uncle, King Kamsa, that he would be killed by his sister Devaki’s child. So Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and had each child she bore murdered. However, Devaki, and her husband, Vasudeva, finally were able to sneak one child off to safety. This was Sri Krishna. They sent Krishna off to Vraja, where he was raised by a foster mother, Yasoda. It was in Vrindavan, one of the villages of Vraja, that Krishna won the hearts of the gopis, the cowherds of the village. “By spending all his time with the gopis of Vrindavan—playing with them, joking with them, stealing their butter and milk, etc—what he actually was doing was stealing their hearts,” Amma says. It is from this that Krishna was given the name “Chitta Chora” [one who steals the mind].</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-krishna-tattoo/">Lord Krishna Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The compass tattoo has been a popular choice among a majority of cultures for centuries. This maritime symbol was popular among early sailors. Getting a compass tattoo would protect them. On rough waters and ensure that you would return home safely.</p><p>One of the main reasons sailors opted for this tattoo was that of protection. As a token of good luck, images of compasses painted on the ships as well. The seas were rough and unforgiving. Often times ships and the men onboard would disappear without a trace so these images served as a beacon of hope that they would be guided out of the treacherous waters alive.</p><p>Compass tattoos can come in a variety of styles and variations. These include,&nbsp;star compass, astrocompass, lodestone compass, Vegvisir compass and prismatic compass.</p><p><strong>The star compass is the most popular of the aforementioned designs and is said to represent the North Star.</strong></p><p>Before maps and technology existed, humans used the North Star to guide them in the right direction. Because of this, this style of tattoo stands for guidance, direction and finding a way home.</p><p>A way of depicting this is to include an image of a clock or hourglass with the compass in the tattoo design. Maps and earth play a role as well as maps, like compasses, help a user determine their location.</p><p>Compass tattoos have also represented the ideal of following one’s dreams. It is symbolic of staying your course in life and to not give up no matter how rough things may seem.</p><p>The compass will guide you where you need to be.</p><p>Overall, this type of tattoo conveys guidance and direction, but you may add additional design elements to your tattoo to have it depict a meaning that is significant to you.</p><p>#compasstattoo #ClockAndCompassTattoo #Compass #tattoo #tattoos #girlswithtattoos #tattooed #tattooartist #tattooart #tattooedgirls #guyswithtattoos #instatattoo #tattoolife #tattoodesign #traditionaltattoo #tattooflash #tattooist #tattoogirl #handtattoo #tattooedgirl #sleevetattoo #tattooing #tattooshop #blacktattoo #chesttattoo #tattoosofinstagram #rosetattoo #blackandgreytattoo #tattoomodel #tattooer #colortattoo</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/anchor-compass-tattoo/">Anchor Compass Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A roaring lion is an animal to be respected and feared. It is a symbol of Power and Authority and a sign that you aren&#8217;t a person to be taken lightly. Roaring lions are born leaders, gifted fighters, and, in a crunch, are the persons who can best guide the group out of danger.&nbsp;<span class="s1">According to </span><span class="s1">t</span><span class="s1">he tradition</span>, a lion whelp was still-born but brought to life by the roar of his father. The whelp later went on to create and lead the tribes of Israel. The symbolism shows that the word of the Divine (represented by the roaring Lion) has the power to breathe life into weakest being (the whelp) and transform him into a force to be reckoned with. A Roaring Lion Tattoo expresses to the world that you aren&#8217;t a pushover and that a beast lies underneath the surface, primed and ready to strike.</p><p>Aside from the basic verbal symbolism of the lion, there are some deeper meanings connected to them as well.</p><p>Lion tattoos have been placed on men throughout history. Those in Asia, Africa, India and the Middle East have put great emphasis on the lion tattoo for many centuries. Lions have always known as the king of the jungle and this status portrays great power. I think this has always been the big draw about the lion tattoo. If you think about it, the lion can also be a symbol of a religious nature. King of the Jungle – King of Kings.</p><p><b>Ancient Civilizations</b></p><p>The lion has been portrayed for many years in ancient cultures, legends, mythology, astrology, literature, movies, and much more. In a few ancient civilizations, lions were owned by kings and royalty. The lion was a symbol of power to the people of the king&#8217;s&nbsp;power&nbsp;and&nbsp;strength. In an interesting contrast, in Roman mythology, the lion is associated with&nbsp;love.</p><p>The lion was also symbolic to the Egyptians they often portrayed two lions with their backs to one another. These statues represented&nbsp;balance, which was very important to the Egyptians. They would usually place these statues outside of sacred structures. The Egyptians believed in balance, such as sunrise sunset and east-west their lion statues represented this all-important balance.</p><p><strong>Religion</strong></p><p>The lion is also a symbol of Christianity. Some Christians use the lion tattoo to symbolize Christian beliefs. The lion is also a symbolic figure to Islam, in which the lion and the sword represent power. The lion is also a solar animal. This means that the lion has sun-like qualities and characteristics. In many culture and beliefs, the lion is associated with the sun. It is said that the the lion&#8217;s mane looks like the rays of the sun—a trait that many tattoos often highlight. In other ancient myths, the lion represents the&nbsp;transformation&nbsp;and journey from childhood to adulthood.</p><p><strong>Culture</strong></p><p>The lion is also very symbolic to the Chinese. It represents a symbol of good luck,&nbsp;guardianship, and power. The Chinese also believe that the lion is a symbol of the earth and sun. Many people know that the lion &#8220;Leo&#8221; is part of the Zodiac. Leo is the 5th sign of the Zodiac, and anyone born between July 23-August 22 is considered to be a Leo. People born during this time are very highly energetic and are good hearted people. The Leo is somewhat timid and enjoys control, but they are very generous. The Leo also represents balance.</p><p>As you now know, the lion has been portrayed throughout human history and they have been symbolic figures for many years. It is one of the most symbolic animal tattoos that are available. Due to all the different meanings it holds, it is highly sought after in the tattoo world. There are also a variety of different designs and styles for it as well. There are tribal designs and Celtic designs, and many more. Before choosing a final design, make sure you check out every style and design that is available. Make sure you choose a design that you are satisfied with.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lion-tattoos-on-arm-2/">Lion Tattoos on Arm</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
