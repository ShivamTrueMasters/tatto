To numerous tribes across North America and in other parts of the world, wolves are very powerful and important.</p><p>The eye of Providence design is also by the secret society of the Free Masons, DARPA.

Which led some to believe that the symbol also holds a darker connotation.</p><p>Those who follow this line of thought believe that the all-seeing eye is used as a subconscious marker or a way to denote covert control of the world by a group of ultra-elite oligarchs, leaders of industry and politicians, known as the “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><span class="s1">illuminati</span></a>”, or “enlightened ones”.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/wolf-tattoo/">Wolf Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Some complex turtle designs could have quite a lot of meanings, according to its elements embedded in. Basically, turtle shells symbolize longevity, wellness, fertility, and peace</p><p><strong>Shark Teeth</strong></p><p>Shark teeth are another fish symbol which is very popular among Polynesian tattoo fans.&nbsp; Nearly over 50% of Polynesian tattoo designs have shark teeth symbols embedded in.</p><p>Shark teeth usually represent shelter or coverage, guidance, power, ferocity, adaptability, etc. In Polynesian legend, sharks also represent the god of Polynesian people.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sagittarius is the 9th sign that features in the zodiac wheel. It is also among the final 3 fire signs of the zodiac collection. It is mostly represented by an archer or the symbol of an archer. This archer will have a bow and an arrow and will be joined to a horse. Basically, it is a sign that shows half a person and half horse. The body of the human being is what will replace the head of the horse, but the other part is complete of a horse. The sign also represents people born between November the 23rd and December the 21st.</p><p>The Sagittarius Sign Tattoo or character can be applied on the body and they represent pride, passion, fury, courage, and independence.</p><p>The wearer of the tattoo will most likely have these personalities. They are also persons that can face any sort of challenge, without fear.</p><p>All of us are possessive about our identity and it means a lot to us. We express it in different ways and the sun sign tattoos are also a way of expressing our identity. People who belong to the Sagittarius sun sign are natural tattoo lovers as they are blessed with an artistic bent of mind. They love to explore and research and are also very fiery and straight-forward. The Sagittarius tattoos are best for conveying the fact that one was born under the ninth sign of the zodiac and is ruled by the fire element.</p><p>The tattoo has got a very sexy display and stands out from all other sun signs tattoos. The centaur and the archer represent the Sagittarians. The arrow is the symbol of the ardent and passionate sun sign. Men and women love both the designs. Those who want a simple and cute look generally go for the symbol while the ones wishing for an elaborate and catchy display choose the centaur and the archer.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/sagittarius-zodiac-tattoo/">Sagittarius Sign Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos have different connotations and the owl tattoo meaning is just among such. As a bird, the owl has been linked to many things useful in giving the best meaning to your owl tattoo. Different cultures have attached different meanings to the owl tattoo. Some of the cultures that have found interest in the owl are the Egyptian, Celtic, and Hindu among others.</p><p>The ancient Greeks revered the goddess Athena, who was supposed to be the goddess of&nbsp;<b>wisdom</b>&nbsp;and guardian of the Acropolis. Her symbol was the owl, so the bird became a symbol of higher&nbsp;<b>wisdom</b>. The owl was a bird of prophecy and wisdom<b></b>&nbsp;in many ancient cultures</p><p><b>Symbol of wisdom, education, and intelligence</b></p><p>Undeniably, the owl is a carrier of many symbols. However, this is not a big surprise because the bird’s appearance is unique. It is rarely seen especially during the day. Mostly, it can be found at night, and therefore the beliefs can be many. It represents something precious that is not easily found but through a struggle and great search.</p><p>The owl tattoo is a complicated and beautiful work of design that is very much appealing to the eye. For a long time now, the owl tattoo symbolism is connected to education and wisdom.&nbsp;The Native Americans believe the owl to be the protector of sacred knowledge, hence regard it as a symbol of intelligence.</p><p><b>Symbol of freedom and vision</b></p><p>Just like the beliefs that birds are known to be free by flying wherever they please, the owl tattoo can symbolize freedom.</p><p>The owl with its big eyes is a great hunter. It is known to look for its food in an organized quiet manner even when flapping its wings. An owl tattoo will thus be used to symbolize vision.&nbsp;Weather forecasters of ancient times used the owl in their work. It was also useful in telling important weather conditions for different seasons.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/owl-tattoo-designs/">Owl Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Wolf Head Tattoo</strong></p><p>Many different cultures throughout history, most notably with Native Americans: too numerous tribes across North America and in other parts of the world, wolves are very powerful and important.</p><p><strong>Wolves have survived in harsh locations for tens of thousands of years.</strong></p><p>They are intelligent and skillful hunters who rarely hunt alone (unless they have been cast out of the pack). Wolves live and hunt in packs, tight-knit family groups that increase their chances of survival.</p><p>Native Americans viewed the wolf as a totem animal or spirit sent to help guide us through life, symbolizing loyalty and perseverance. In legends, the wolf had great powers given by the Great Spirit. Wolves also had the power to change into people.</p><p><strong>The Wolf Head Tattoo is a very symbolic creature that holds deep meaning.</strong></p><p>Wolves are strongly associated with the family. Because they live and hunt in packs, they have survived. The pack also gives them a territorial advantage against other predators. A wolf will only mate with one partner while the pair is alive. Because they mate for life, and because the whole pack will help take care of the pups, wolves are also known as caring parents. Thus a wolf tattoo can symbolize tight family bonds.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/wolf-head-tattoo/">Wolf Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Coverup Tattoo</strong></p><p>The tiger&#8217;s eye<span class="s1"><a href="http://gemstone-dictionary.com/tigers-eye">&nbsp;</a>is more than gemstone</span>; it is a symbol of Focus, Patience, and Determination. A Tiger Eye Tattoo symbolizes your most primitive desires; you are moving and thinking simply on instinct and drive. The eye of the tiger represents the animal in its purest state; it is stalking, hungry, focused, and, most importantly, lethal.</p><p><strong>Tiger Eye Tattoo Designs</strong></p><p>When it comes to animal tattoos, the tiger ranks up there with the best of them. Tigers have been a part of fashion, magic acts, and carnivals for years. Their beautiful stripes make them very attractive in fashion, art, and tattoos. Although the lion is considered to be the king of the jungle, it is actually the tiger. The largest percentage of tigers live in the dense jungles of Asia. Due to the popularity of their fur coats, they&#8217;re on the endangered species list. The beauty and symbolism of the tiger has made it a highly sought-after tattoo.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The Bengal and Siberian tigers are absolutely beautiful animals. The Bengal is orange with black stripes, while the Siberian is white with black stripes.</li><li>They are deadly jungle predators. The humans who still live in the jungles where these tigers roam have to be on constant alert for them. One of the tiger&#8217;s strengths is his ability to hunt and ambush his prey without detection.</li><li>The tiger has played a very important role in Asian cultures, such as China and Japan. In these cultures, the tiger ranks right up there with the dragon. You may also see tiger tattoos that actually have a dragon.</li><li>Japanese Samurai had tigers on their crests.</li><li>As you have already read, the tiger is an endangered animal. Due to this fact, the tiger tattoo has become very important for those who care about the tiger species and conservation. These people wear the tiger tattoo with pride as a reminder of their work.</li><li>As of today, there are only a few thousand left in the entire world. The species became endangered after people had been hunting them for their fur.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/tiger-eye-tattoo-designs/">Tiger Eye Tattoo Designs</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Lion Foot Scratch / Claw Tattoo</strong></p><p>Deciding on a claw tattoo design can be tricky &#8211; there are so many to choose from! Much of the symbolism of this tattoo will derive from the animal whose claws you&#8217;re representing. From bear to dragon to panther, these animals all have intense symbolic meanings that stretch across time and cultures around the world.</p><p>The bear claw is one of the most prominent claw tattoo designs &#8211; but no, this tattoo isn&#8217;t of a delicious breakfast pastry! Native American cultures have long revered the bear for its strength, power, and warrior-like nature, and the bear is a popular totem animal among many Native Americans. The bear is free in spirit, but this trait can also be coupled with unpredictability. As the saying goes: don&#8217;t poke the bear! The bear also has a gentle, maternal nature: mother bears will protect their cubs with ferocity, making the bear a symbol of protective parents.</p><p>Eagles also serve as important creatures in Native American cultures, where they represented the physical manifestation of the great Thunderbird spirit. This spirit could shoot bolts of lightning from the eyes of the bald eagle, and a flap of its wings would bring powerful rainstorms. This connection to nature is an important quality of the eagle, making an eagle claw tattoo a great choice for someone who cares deeply for nature and its creatures. In popular American culture, the eagle is also a national symbol, making eagle claws a great tattoo choice for any patriotic American; indeed, it is particularly popular among current and former servicemen and women.</p><p>Dragons are one of the most prominent mythological creatures, and their symbolism abounds in both ancient and modern culture. Though tattoos are often gender-neutral in their meaning, the dragon is one exception. On women, dragons can represent how woman is the ultimate creator of life, as well as the immense power that is underneath the surface of her outward reserve and gentle appearance. On men, a dragon tattoo can represent a combination of wisdom and power: they are both revered and feared. Dragons also have appeared in mythologies from around the world. For instance, in various folklores from Europe, dragons were the ultimate foe of brave knights. Who had to slay this beast in order to rescue a princess, save a kingdom, or to finish a quest. In many Asian cultures, the dragon is a water animal that symbolizes meditation and the subconscious.</p><p>While wolves themselves are becoming more mainstream tattoos, do something different by having just its claws tattooed on your body. The symbolism of wolves is recognized the world over: they are strong, intelligent creatures that hunt best when in packs. This independent, yet social creature is closely related to the dog that many of us love as pets. And can therefore represent how close we ourselves are to the wild. Within ancient cultures, the wolf was an especially potent symbol in ancient Rome. Whose founders, Romulus and Remus, were raised by a she-wolf. In Celtic symbolism, the wolf is closely connected to lunar power, as Celtic mythology. Contends that every evening the wolf would hunt down. And devour the sun in order to let the power of the moon to shine through.</p><p>Another great animal claw tattoo is that of the panther. This graceful yet ferocious creature is especially prominent in the cultures and mythologies of Central and South America. In many of these cultures, the panther was considered to be a familiar animal to the Shamans. And as a totem animal, the panther was symbolic of the nobility and authority of the royal families. The panther&#8217;s complex and intricate body, consisting of over 500 voluntary muscles. Also makes this animal a great personal symbol for anyone who is dedicated to health, fitness. Simply keeping their mind and body in perfect harmony.</p><p><strong>The Meanings of Claw Tattoos</strong></p><p>The meaning of your claw tattoo will depend on the animal whose claws you represent. In general, the animals and claws mentioned above can represent the following, though this list is by no means exhaustive. Strength, Resistance, Ferocity, Maternal/paternal instinct, Power, Creation, Knowledge and intelligence, Quest/journey, Connection to nature, Pack member, Gracefulness, Nobility, Mind-body connectivity.</p><p>#lionfootscratchtattoo #scratch #tattoo #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #anchortattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #letteringtattoo #liontattoo #skulltattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/claw-tattoo/">Claw Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a tattoo that has a lot of attitude, history and lore, consider the myriad of scorpion tattoos available. The scorpion carries with it a storied history. You might be interested in a scorpion tattoo because Scorpio is your zodiac sign or because you enjoy the dark and foreboding sense that scorpions give. Perhaps it’s just because they look cool.</p><p>Scorpion tattoos can be dark and forbidding, but they can also be a lot more attractive than you might think. These tiny, deadly desert creatures – in appearance, a cross between a spider and a tiny lobster – have gracefully curved bodies that lend themselves well to tattoo designs.</p><p>A scorpion tattoo can look exotic and intriguing on a man or a woman – all in all, a great image for someone who wants a tattoo with a little bit of ‘edge’, or one that is a little beyond the ordinary.</p><p>Scorpion tattoos can be large or small, and they can have as much or as little detail as you’d like. In any case, it will be immediately recognizable – because even those of us who have never seen an actual scorpion seem to have an innate recognition of the symbol and all that it represents.</p><p><strong>Scorpion Tattoos And Their Meaning</strong></p><p><strong>Scorpion art is part of the folklore and symbolism of many different cultures and has various meanings:</strong></p><p><strong>Greek Mythology:</strong></p><p>The scorpion is featured in its own mythological tale. When Orion, a giant who was more than human but less than a God, incurred the wrath of Artemis, she called upon a scorpion to attack him. The scorpion’s sting made Orion immortal in the form of the constellation of Orion.</p><p>Another story goes that when Medusa was slain by Perseus, the blood that leaked out of Medusa’s neck turned into snakes and scorpions.</p><p><strong>The Bible:</strong></p><p>The Bible uses the story of Israelites trampling scorpions as a metaphor for achieving victory over the terrible acts brought on by the devil.</p><p><strong>Ancient Egypt:</strong></p><p>There was an Egyptian scorpion goddess that was thought to help ease the pain of childbirth (if women prayed to her appropriately). The scorpion, therefore, stood a lasting symbol of maternal sacrifice.</p><p>The scorpion was also associated with the ancient Egyptian god of the desert, called Set.</p><p><strong>The Mayas:</strong></p><p>Because the scorpion numbs its prey before stinging, the ancient Mayans associated the scorpion with surgery.</p><p><strong>Mexico:</strong></p><p>The scorpion is the symbol of Durango, a state in Mexico.</p><p><strong>Buddhism:</strong></p><p>Scorpions were found in designs on sword handles and amulets in Tibet and a variety of other Buddhist cultures.</p><p>#scorpiontattoo #scorpion #tattoo #tattoos #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #anchortattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #letteringtattoo #skulltattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/scorpion-tattoo/">Scorpion Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the king of the jungle, the lion is inarguably one of the world’s most prominent symbols of power and leadership. In addition to representing supremacy, it is also a creature that is known for its courage and pride.</p><p>While some tattoos feature lions baring their teeth and appearing ferocious, others present their calm and peaceful side.</p><p>In a Biblical sense, a lion is considered to be a creature that defends the weak and watches over those with lesser strength than itself. In fact, Jesus Christ is referred to on countless occasions as “the lion of Judah.” By fusing their images together, this tattoo represents the fact that Christians see Jesus as a symbolic lion that has been sent to Earth to make up for their inadequacies.</p><p>The large size of this tattoo shows off the sizeable presence a lion’s power can have on those surrounding it. Because the elements of a lion’s mug are easy to enlarge, it makes for a gorgeous back piece that accentuates the natural curves and structure of the body.</p><p>While a lion’s flowing mane and bold features can make it a beautiful mural piece that takes up lots of space on your body, the image of a lion also looks pretty amazing when inked on back side of body.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lion-tribal-tattoo/">Lion Tribal Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Ancient Chinese history, the Tiger, being predators and hunters in nature, represents the masculine principle and is King of all animals.

For over centuries, these super intelligent creatures have been major motifs in Chinese (and even Japanese) art. Let’s check out these ferociously awesome &amp; beautiful tiger tattoo in esoteric wisdom along the way. Enjoy! 🙂</p><p>The Tiger represents strength, vitality and health.
