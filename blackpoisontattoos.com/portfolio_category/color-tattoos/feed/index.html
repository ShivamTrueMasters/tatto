										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos are one of the most personal and creative forms of self-expression. Among the endless design possibilities, blue floral tattoos have a unique allure. Positioned on the back, these designs offer a combination of elegance, symbolism, and aesthetic beauty, making them a top choice for many women. In this post, we’ll explore the artistic significance and reasons why a blue floral tattoo on the back can be a stunning addition to your body art.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-choose-a-floral-tattoo">Why Choose a Floral Tattoo?</h3><p>Floral tattoos are timeless. Flowers symbolize a variety of emotions and concepts—from love and passion to purity and serenity. For centuries, flowers have been used as a form of communication. The art of &#8220;floriography,&#8221; or the language of flowers, dates back to ancient civilizations where each bloom held specific meanings. A tattoo allows you to express these messages permanently in a design that reflects your personal story.</p><p>For women, the back is an ideal canvas for large, detailed designs. With ample space to work with, tattoo artists can create intricate patterns, letting the floral motif flow naturally. The design can stretch across the shoulders or cascade down the spine, blending with the natural curvature of the body for a truly mesmerizing effect.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-symbolism-behind-blue-floral-tattoos">The Symbolism Behind Blue Floral Tattoos</h3><p>The color blue itself holds deep meaning. Blue flowers are often associated with calmness, wisdom, and tranquility. They symbolize peace and the pursuit of the impossible, as blue flowers are rare in nature. A blue floral tattoo brings together these elements of serenity and introspection while adding a unique pop of color against the skin.</p><p>Here are a few flowers often seen in blue floral tattoos and their meanings:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Blue Rose:</strong> Symbolizes mystery, intrigue, and the impossible.</li>

<li><strong>Forget-Me-Not:</strong> Represents true love and remembrance.</li>

<li><strong>Blue Lotus:</strong> Signifies wisdom, knowledge, and spiritual awakening.</li>

<li><strong>Cornflower:</strong> Often associated with hope, loyalty, and devotion.</li></ul><p>Each flower has a different significance, and depending on what speaks to you, your blue floral tattoo can be customized to embody the traits you most value.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-back-is-the-perfect-canvas">Why the Back is the Perfect Canvas</h3><p>The back offers a broad, flat area for a tattoo artist to showcase their skills. Unlike other parts of the body, it allows for larger and more detailed designs. A tattoo on the back can remain hidden under clothing, offering the flexibility to reveal or conceal it as desired. For women, the back provides a more intimate placement that still allows for bold artistic expression.</p><p>Another appeal of back tattoos is that they age well. Since the back is less exposed to sunlight compared to other areas like the arms or legs, it’s less prone to fading, ensuring that your blue floral tattoo will remain vibrant for years to come.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-designing-your-blue-floral-tattoo">Designing Your Blue Floral Tattoo</h3><p>When it comes to designing a blue floral tattoo, there’s no shortage of inspiration. Many women choose to incorporate vines or other natural elements that complement the floral design. Vines can be used to connect multiple flowers, creating a flowing, organic look that follows the natural lines of the back.</p><p>Additionally, some choose to include other symbols that hold personal meaning. Butterflies, birds, or even celestial elements like stars and moons can add depth and personalization to the design. Collaborating with a skilled tattoo artist ensures that your design not only looks beautiful but also resonates with your individual story.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-tattoo-process-what-to-expect">The Tattoo Process: What to Expect</h3><p>Getting a tattoo on your back is a bit more involved than on other parts of your body. Depending on the size and complexity of the design, it may take multiple sessions to complete. Before starting, your artist will usually create a stencil of your design, giving you a chance to approve the placement and look.</p><p>It’s important to choose a reputable tattoo artist, especially for a design as detailed as a floral back tattoo. Look for someone with experience in fine line work and color shading to ensure the blue hues come out vibrant and even.</p><p>During the healing process, you’ll need to follow the aftercare instructions carefully. Since your back might rub against clothing, it&#8217;s crucial to keep the area clean and moisturized to prevent irritation and promote proper healing.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3><p>A blue floral tattoo on the back is more than just body art—it’s a statement. Whether you’re drawn to the symbolism of blue flowers or the aesthetic appeal of a detailed, flowing design, this type of tattoo offers a unique blend of beauty and meaning. For women looking to make a bold yet elegant choice, a blue floral tattoo on the back is a design that will stand the test of time.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/blue-floral-tattoo-on-back-of-a-girl/">Blue Floral Tattoo on Back of a Girl: A Timeless Design Choice</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

It&#8217;s feminine, vibrant, and fun. They&#8217;re also easier to hide or conceal than other types of tattoos.</p><p>A colorful flower tattoo is always an excellent choice!</p><p>Flower tattoos can be placed on any part of the body. They are very versatile and can be used as an accent tattoo, a full sleeve tattoo, or even just a simple single flower placed in an unusual place.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-watercolor-flower-tattoo">Watercolor Flower Tattoo</h4><p>The watercolor flower tattoo is a great piece to show off your love of the arts. Watercolor flower tattoos have been around for quite some time and they are still as popular as ever. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to express yourself, this is one of the best ways to do so!</p><p>Watercolor artwork can be done in many different ways:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Outline &#8211; A solid outline without any shading or highlighting will create an image that appears flat on your skin. This style can be used on its own or combined with other styles such as dotwork or linework for extra detail and dimensionality.</li><li>Dotwork &#8211; Similar in appearance to block color tattoos, but instead of using blocks of solid color, dots create patterns within each flower shape that create depth and shading effects just like paint would appear while being applied to the paper surface; this adds more dimensionality than simply outlining everything would provide alone since it separates each individual petal with its own layer instead just drawing one single line around them all together making them seem less connected together than they are.</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-light-purple-iris-flower-tattoo">Light Purple Iris Flower Tattoo</h4><p>Flower tattoos are one of the most popular types of tattoo designs, and there are many reasons why they’re so popular. For one thing, flowers can be used as symbols or reminders of important life events and milestones. For example, if you got married on a certain day or your first child was born on a certain day, you might want to commemorate those dates with flowers in your tattoo design.</p><p>If you have someone in mind when considering getting a flower tattoo (like an ex-partner), it’s important to make sure that person is someone who meant something special to you before getting a flower tattoo. If not, then it may feel like they were just another person in your life that didn’t mean anything special at all!</p><p>Flowers also represent beauty and happiness which makes them perfect for any girl looking for ways she can boost her self-esteem after having been through some tough times lately.&#8221;</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dark-purple-iris-flower-tattoo">Dark Purple Iris Flower Tattoo</h4><p>You can make a dark purple iris flower tattoo by using a thin brush and black ink. This is one of the most popular flowers for tattoos because its meaning is so deep. The iris flower symbolizes feelings of love, compassion, and respect. It&#8217;s also associated with faithfulness, loyalty, and honor to your family members.</p><p>Of course, there are several types of this particular flower that you can use as inspiration for your own tattoo design:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Purple Iris Tattoo Designs: This type has leaves that resemble the shape of maple leaves but have purple petals instead of green ones. A great example would be Victor Cruz&#8217;s arm tattoo! He got it done right underneath his sleeve; this allows him to cover it when he puts on his jersey during games without having to worry about hiding anything important in there like his number 97 (which also happens to be his favorite number).</li><li>Blue Iris Tattoo Designs: Another variation of this design will use only blue instead &#8211; usually lighter shades though not always true; some artists prefer darker hues such as midnight sky tones or even navy blue color schemes which might seem strange since they&#8217;re not what we typically expect from something called &#8220;blue iris.&#8221; However, if done correctly then these designs would look stunning especially if paired with other types such as yellow roses or red tulips (or both!)!!!</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-flower-tattoo-is-a-popular-tattoo-choice-for-women">A flower tattoo is a popular tattoo choice for women.</h4><p>A flower tattoo is a popular tattoo choice for women. A flower tattoo is also a popular choice for men and couples, who like to get matching flower tattoos. This particular flower tattoo has an interesting element of lettering on the left of it, and it makes this design pop!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>We hope you enjoyed this watercolor flower tattoo and its meaning. If you&#8217;re interested in getting one yourself, make sure to choose the right design based on your personality and interests! Remember: flowers are symbols of beauty, hope, love, and other positive things that can help you express yourself through body art.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/watercolor-flower-tattoo/">Watercolor Flower Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Rose Tattoo</p><p>There are many myths and legends surrounding the creation of the rose. Its beauty, its fragrance, even the thorns have stories that explain the conception of this glorious flower. These rose tattoos are awesome embodiments of humans&#8217; constant attraction to a flower that has had everyone smitten since the dawn of time.</p><p>It was a symbol of love and beauty associated with the goddess, but also came to stand for secrecy after Cupid offered a rose to the God of Silence to keep quiet Venus’s affairs. In fact, Roman dining room ceilings were decorated with roses to urge guests to keep quiet about what was said at dinner, and “sub rosa” or “under the rose” still means “confidentially” today.&#8221;</p><p>The traditional red rose tattoo symbolizes love and passion. A pink rose represents grace, gratitude, and affection while purple roses have been used to symbolize royalty and enchantment.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><p>Thus, for instance, in Greece this flower symbolized the blood of Aphrodite, in Rome it has been connected with the goddess Diana, who has transformed her lover into a rose, in Egypt it was a favorite flower of Isis, in Christian countries the rose has been associated with the blood of Christ. In the East, this flower was the sign of pure and sincere love.</p><p>In the current world, the denotation of the rose depends on its color and it doesn’t matter where the tattoo will be placed.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A black rose denotes tragic love, various subcultures invest their own meaning. Hence, for example, goths reckon that the black rose is death, for anarchists the same symbol is the fight.</li><li>A white rose shows pure love and a faithful essence of its owner.</li><li>A red rose indicates passion, desire, and love, whereas a burgundy rose spells out the idea of inner harmony.</li><li>A blue rose represents a sophisticated nature of a human, who wears it. He or she renounces all rules and foundations, adopted in the society, besides, this person strives for something unattainable.</li><li>A yellow rose has altered its meaning: at first, it meant jealousy, but now it connotes dedication.</li><li>An orange rose conveys that the owner is enthusiastic and attractive.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/rose-tattoo-3/">Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A child, a brother, a charioteer, a warrior, a disciple, a guru, a cowherd, a messenger, the beloved of the gopis… Throughout his life, Krishna enacted so many roles—the whole time never forgetting. That they were just that, roles, and that his true nature was eternal, ever blissful consciousness. In this way, he was able to remain detached and thus perform flawlessly, never allowing the smile to fall from his face.</p><p><strong>“There have been very few who have been able to rejoice both in victory and in defeat,”</strong></p><p>Amma says. “Sri Krishna is one who celebrated both life and death. That is why he was always able to give a big smile.</p><p>He took birth with a smile on his face, lived with a smile, and left his body with a smile. The message that he conveyed through his life is that we should make life full of laughter.”</p><p>Krishna’s life was so full, it would be impossible to recount it all here. It is told primarily through Srimad Bhagavatam, Garga Samhita, Visnu Purana, Brahmavaivarta Purana, Mahabharata, Harivamsa and several other Puranas. However, here are some of the broad strokes.</p><p>Krishna, in fact, took birth in a prison cell. A sage had told his egoistic uncle, King Kamsa, that he would be killed by his sister Devaki’s child. So Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and had each child she bore murdered. However, Devaki, and her husband, Vasudeva, finally were able to sneak one child off to safety. This was Sri Krishna. They sent Krishna off to Vraja, where he was raised by a foster mother, Yasoda. It was in Vrindavan, one of the villages of Vraja, that Krishna won the hearts of the gopis, the cowherds of the village. “By spending all his time with the gopis of Vrindavan—playing with them, joking with them, stealing their butter and milk, etc—what he actually was doing was stealing their hearts,” Amma says. It is from this that Krishna was given the name “Chitta Chora” [one who steals the mind].</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-krishna-tattoo/">Lord Krishna Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="ctl01_mainContent_39661"><strong>The Five Eternal Elements</strong></p><p>When Bhagwan Swaminarayan set out on His spiritual journey at eleven years of age, He halted only after getting a reply to the question He had asked all across India. On His quest, He asked about the five eternal elements as revealed in the Vedas. He found a reasonable answer in Loj from Ramananad Swami’s chief disciple, Muktanand Swami. He accepted Ramanand Swami as His guru and then established the Swaminarayan Sampraday in Gujarat. Bhagwan Swaminarayan describes these five eternal elements and their relationship in great detail throughout the Vachanamrut.</p><p><strong>Pramukh Swami Tattoo Design,These five eternal elements are: Jiva, Ishwar, Maya, Brahma, and Parabrahma. </strong></p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl07_divpagercontrol"><strong>Jiva – The Soul</strong></p><p>One’s true identity is not this human body, but the jiva that resides within it.&nbsp;The jiva, also called ‘atma’ or soul, is eternal – it cannot be destroyed. The jiva has no gender; it is neither male nor female.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan discusses the nature of the jiva throughout the Vachanamrut.&nbsp;It is said to reside in our bodies in the same area as the heart.&nbsp;“Childhood, youth, old age, stoutness, thinness, birth and death are all aspects of the body.</p><p>On the other hand, being uncuttable, being unpierceable, not aging, being immortal, being the embodiment of gnan [wisdom], being the embodiment of bliss, and being characterized by eternal existence are all aspects of the atma; they should in no way be considered as belonging to the body.” The jiva is free and pure, but we believe that we are restrained by maya. Once we understand that we are not this body and worship Purna Purushottam Narayan, we realize that our jiva is free from the clutches of maya and is worthy of moksha. The very essence of the Brahma-Parabrahma spiritual journey is to believe one’s self to be the atma and not this body, to become atmarup, and to worship Purna Purshottam Narayan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ishwar – Divinities</strong></p><p>Ishwar transcends the jiva. It is the next element above the jiva.&nbsp;These beings partake in the creation, sustenance, and destruction of each universe.&nbsp;Ishwars are conscious spiritual beings that have greater realization than jivas.</p><p>While the jiva must work to realize its divine presence within the human body, ishwar is aware of that divinity. There are infinite ishwars, and but they are all bound by maya. Just as Purna Purshottam Narayan controls the jiva, He also controls the ishwars. Like the jivas, ishwars too aim to surpass maya and attain moksha.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl09_divpagercontrol"><strong>Maya – Ignorance</strong></p><p>Maya is the ignorance that separates the jivas and ishwars from Brahma and Parabrahma. It is the desire that hinders a spiritual aspirant’s path to moksha. Maya directly translates to attachment for worldly objects. Maya is the instrument through which Parabrahma facilitates karma and moksha. Only when a devotee is able to overcome maya overcome the darkness of attachment to worldly objects is he or she able to attain moksha. Maya manifests from physical matter, and it is difficult for the jiva or ishwar to transcend. Bhagwan Swaminarayan has advocated the jiva to engage in constant bhakti or devotion to God. To move beyond maya and towards one’s liberation.</p><p id="ctl01_mainContent_ctl10_divpagercontrol"><strong>Aksharbrahma – The Eternal Abode</strong></p><p>The gunatit sadhu, Aksharbrahma, is the pathway to God and to moksha. It is only through Aksharbrahma that a jiva can associate itself with God and understand Him well enough to seek complete refuge in Him, thereby bringing the jiva out of the darkness of maya and into the light of Parabrahma. IParabrahma – GodIn the Vachanamrut, Bhagwan Swaminarayan has described this Supreme God as all-knowing, all-powerful and yet compassionate. This Parabrahma governs all the other four elements of jiva, ishwar, maya and brahma. Swaminarayan devotees believe Bhagwan Swaminarayan to be Parabrahma.&nbsp;In the Vibhuti Yoga Adhyaya of the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, Shri Krishna speaks of that Supreme God living and working through him.&nbsp;Bhagwan Swaminarayan in the Vachanamrut says that Purna Purushottam Narayan resides in Akshardham and visits this Earth to establish dharma for the sake of His devotees. He is always present in human form (pragat).&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/pramukh-swami-tattoo-design/">Pramukh Swami Tattoo Design</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feathers are generally a very beautiful and gentle tattoo designs. Lots of girls and guys choose peacock feather simply because it is more beautiful than other feathers, while only a small number associates the feather to the meaning of peacock tattoos.</p><p>Feathers symbolize creativity, spiritual evaluation, and rebirth. Most common places for a peacock feather are ribs, scapulas or a side of the lower back. Peacock <a href="http://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/amazing-feather-tattoos-which-will-encourage-you-to-be-inked-immediately/">feather tattoos</a> should, by all means, be done in full color – it is the colors that make it so beautiful.</p><p>Within the design of the peacock feather is what appears to be an eye, and that is part of the reason the peacock is also known as the bird of 100 eyes. The reference is directly related to the pattern of the eye that appears in its feathers, and these little birds are also thought to be all-seeing.</p><p>Peacock feathers, or mor pankh, are regarded as an auspicious symbol in Hindu mythology because of their association with the peacock, a beautiful bird which is also the national bird of India. You may have noticed that many people keep peacock feathers in their homes. It is believed that keeping peacock feathers at home brings good luck and prosperity into the house.</p><p>This design today is symbolic of a person who has an open mind, someone who sees the world with both their eyes open, or someone that is definitely not afraid of the challenges that lie ahead.</p><p>Peacock feather tattoo could indicate a very proud person. It could be comprehended in two ways. The person wearing it could either be very proud of herself for good reasons or simply very arrogant.</p><p><b>The&nbsp;Meaning&nbsp;of Ganesh</b></p><p><b>Gan<i>&nbsp;</i></b>means group. A universe is a group of atoms and different energies. This universe would be in chaos if there was no supreme law governing these diverse groups of entities.<br><b>The Lord of all these groups of atoms and energies is&nbsp;</b><strong>Ganesha</strong><b>.&nbsp;</b></p><p>He is the supreme consciousness that pervades all and brings order in this universe.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/peacock-feather-flute-ganesha-tattoo/">Peacock Feather with Flute Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Infinity tattoos are steadily on the rise with many people opting to get these in one form or another.</strong></p><p>The infinity symbol, often used in mathematics, represents a never-ending loop and is depicted as a number 8 on its side. In the tattoo world, this can be seen as a symbol of never-ending or limitless possibility. Some cultures also believe it to represent rebirth or reincarnation.</p><p>Historically, this symbol is similar to mythological creatures such as Ouroboros; the snake which consumed its tail and became a creature without end. Often when people get their infinity tattoo, for this reason, they are showing that they are both into mythology and that they like the creatures that the symbol represents. These aren’t the deepest meanings for the infinity tattoo, but they can always attach more meanings to the design later on.</p><p><strong>The endless loops and circles that comprise the infinity symbol can also be likened to the seasonal cycle which endlessly repeats year after year.</strong></p><p>In this way, the infinity tattoo could mean that the person wants to keep their eye on the ball no matter what time of year it is. It could also mean that they don’t necessarily have a favorite season. But instead choose to enjoy their lives regardless of the time of year it currently is.</p><p>These infinity tattoos, while simple, can be customized in a variety of ways.</p><p>Popular choices for this type of tattoo include a word or phrase. Inside the loop, such as “love”, “life” or “friendship”.</p><p>These, of course, signify a relationship that will never end. And are often used as matching tattoos for two or more people.</p><p>One can even add additional symbols such a hearts, stars or other embellishments. To add to the flair of the design.</p><p>The fact is that the infinity symbol itself is a bit bland unless holds a lot of meaning to you.</p><p>so many people decide to surround it with other images that make the meaning come to life a bit more.</p><p>As always, it comes down to the tastes of the person getting the infinity tattoo.</p><p>If they are able to find a design that works well with the infinity symbol.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/infinity-tattoo/">Infinity Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

It is also called the Arms of&nbsp;Chaos, the Arrows of&nbsp;Chaos, the&nbsp;Chaos&nbsp;Star, the&nbsp;Chaos&nbsp;Cross, the Chaosphere, or the&nbsp;Symbol&nbsp;of Eight.While the peace sign is a highly recognizable symbol, there are many ways that people who wear it can add variety to it and make it a more personal image. People with friends or family in the military will add a yellow ribbon or dog tags to signify their military connection.</p><p class="has-text-align-left">A peace sign can also represent that a person who is going through a rocky transformation or a tumultuous time is keeping their mind focused on the goal. Drawing around the peace sign or within the peace sign also turns the symbol into something more meaningful. Often people will request the flag of a country or a dove to make the picture more meaningful.</p><p><strong>Peace symbol tattoos can actually be a request for two different types of designs.</strong></p><p>This request ether means the circle with the vertical line splitting into three forks or the human hand holding up the index and the middle finger with the thumb overlaid across the ring and pinky fingers; not with the back side of the hand showing. This has a completely different meaning in different &nbsp;parts of the world.</p><p>Inner peace tattoos are calming and relaxing and have several meanings. General inner peace represents a state of spiritual and mental peace.</p><p>There is no single design or rule to live with here. Some symbols that you can use to represent peace include Yin Yang, Buddha, lotus, peace and flowers.</p><p>Tribal peace sign tattoos are among the most popular peace sign designs. The tattoos are inked in many variations mostly portrayed alone or inked with other elements and symbols.

While popular, dreamcatchers do not feature in all Native American cultures.

Obviously, this huge swath of different cultures and locations barely narrows it down, so determining exactly where they originated proves impossible.</p><p>In the 60s and 70s, the Pan-Indian movement sought to unify many different American Indian tribes across the nations to better coordinate their protest of some shady government claims. While many tribes already formed a coalition of nations—even before the Europeans landed on the continent—this surge represented the largest movement to fight back for their land.</p><p>During the Pan-Indian movement, many different tribes shared the unique quirks of their particular tribes and bands. During this time, the dreamcatcher became a popular symbol for many different tribes across a huge swath of North America. People easily recognized it, and it looked awesome. To this day, dreamcatchers appear in traditional shops far away from their original location.</p><p>During this time, the dreamcatcher became a popular symbol for many different tribes across a huge swath of North America.

And carvings left on the walls of temples and tombs. Scholars believe the Egyptians viewed the Lotus as a symbol of rebirth. Because it appeared to sink at night and rise again in the morning. It is the plant simply loses old blooms and adds new ones on a daily cycle, but it is still a potent reminder of reincarnation and the mysteries of the afterlife. The priests and other religious leaders also brewed the flowers to make a tea with sedative and mild psychotropic effects, which heightened their sense for ritual work.</span></p><p><span class="s1"><b>Buddhism Culture</b> – According to Buddhist religion, lotus defines purity and piousness of the soul,Patience,Mysticism,Direct Spiritual Contact,Emptiness from Desire,Victory over Attachments,Enlightenment and the Bodhi State,Love and Compassion for All Things,Self-Awareness,Faithfulness During Spiritual Development,Rising Out of Suffering&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">as the flower grows in a muddy area, yet maintains its purity.

A white colored lotus implies purity and peace, both at spiritual as well as intellectual level. The Buddhist mythology says that the Buddha was born from this pure flower and had a white heart. Which represented his pious soul. Just as a lotus sheds its flowers and seeds together. It signifies a noble soul which guides the other souls on the Earth along the path of Nirvana.</span></p><p><span class="s1"><b>Egyptian Culture </b>–<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The ancient Egyptian cultures sees lotus as a symbol of the beginning of life and reincarnation, as the mythology of this culture narrates that origination of life on earth was marked by the blooming of this mystical flower from the sea.</span></p><p><span class="s1"><b>Chinese Culture</b> –<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The Chinese culture sees lotus as a flower with perfect beauty stands as a source of inspiration for poets and artists.

The habit of rooting in mud and pushing up through the water to bloom.</span></p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/watercolor-lotus-tattoo/">Watercolor Lotus Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">Peacock Feather Tattoo – The peacock is known as the bird with 100 eyes, referring to the pattern on its tail feathers.</a></p><p>These eyes are considered to be all seeing, as well as being the “evil eyes.” The eye on the peacock feather tattoo could mean that you are an open minded person – the one that looks at the world with eyes wide open, the one that is not afraid of challenges. On the other hand, in Egyptian, Roman and Greek mythology, the eye on the peacock feather is considered to be the “evil eye.” This is not always a bad thing – the “evil eye” symbols give the evil eye, as well as, protect the one who wears them.</p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">Peacock Tattoo are generally a very beautiful and gentle feminine tattoo designs.</a></p><p>A lot of girls choose peacock feather simply because it is more beautiful than other feathers, while only a small number associates the feather to the meaning of peacock tattoos.</p><p>Feathers symbolize creativity, spiritual evaluation and rebirth. Most common places for a peacock feather are ribs, scapulas or a side of the lower back. Peacock feather should, by all means, be done in full color – it is the colors that make it so beautiful.</p><p>This is an expression that was first used back in the 14th century, and it is still quite common today. It is also the meaning of a peacock feather tattoo design.</p><p>Peacock feather tattoo could indicate a very proud person. It could be comprehended in two ways – the person wearing it could either be very proud of herself for good reasons, or simply very arrogant. If you don’t want to be perceived as an arrogant person, I’d suggest you choose a smaller tattoo. Rather than one that goes across your whole back.</p><p>The peacock is a very important bird for people in India. It still has a status of a worshiped bird, mainly because it slays snakes. That peacocks are immune to snake bites. Their blood to chase away evil spirits. Peacock feather tattoo can be a symbol of protection against those spirits. Or simply people who would like to hurt you.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/peacock-tattoo/">Peacock Feather Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Waterfall Legend</strong></p><p>Koi is a Japanese word for Carp. Japanese people have, for years, used Koi fish tattoo designs as a cultural symbol for overcoming adversity. Stories are told of how they climb waterfalls that have strong currents.One particular legend is the koi fish’s claim to fame. An ancient tale tells of a huge school of golden koi swimming upstream the Yellow River in China.</p><p>Gaining strengt<span class="text_exposed_show">h by fighting against the current, the school glimmered as they swam together through the river. When they reached a waterfall at the end of the river, many of the koi turned back, letting the flow of the river carry them away.The remaining koi refused to give up. Leaping from the depths of the river, they attempted to reach the top of the waterfall to no avail. Their efforts caught the attention of local demons, who mocked their efforts and heightened the waterfall out of malice. After a hundred years of jumping, one koi finally reached the top of the waterfall.</span></p><p><strong>Koi Fish Meaning</strong></p><p>The koi fish is a symbol with extremely deep meaning for those who choose it as part of their body art. If you have been considering getting a tattoo that involves a koi fish, take the time first to learn the meaning associated with them. The traditional significance of a koi fish tattoo can vary depending on the fish’s orientation (whether it is going up or down your body) and color. You want to be sure that your koi fish tattoo conveys the desired meaning.</p><p>Koi fish have a very long history in Chinese and Japanese culture. They were originally common carp and were later domesticated and bred to produce certain colors. Chinese invaders brought koi to Japan, where the fish flourished. Koi fish are prominent in the work of Japanese tattoo artists because of a long-standing legend of how the fish become dragons. Most of the meaning and symbolism behind the fish stems from this ancient legend.</p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">The gods recognized the koi for its perseverance and determination and turned it into a golden dragon. The image of power and strength. However, the Annunaki (in chariots of gods tattoo), an age of Pisces and dragons.</span><span class="text_exposed_show"><br>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roses are a complex flower and a popular tattoo. Obvious symbolism may be delicate&nbsp;beauty or&nbsp;love, but there is a wealth of culture behind rose symbolism that can be different based on different elements, including color and whether or not the rose is “open.”</p><p>The number of petals on a rose is commonly associated with&nbsp;numerology.</p><p>In mythology, Aphrodite (the Greek goddess of love) was often depicted with roses adorning her head, feet, and neck. This can be interpreted many ways, but the association comes from a rose bush that grew within a pool of blood spilled by her slain lover (Adonis), and so a common interpretation is that the rose symbolizes&nbsp;<strong>an immortal love</strong>&nbsp;that withstands time and even death.</p><p>Roses are not only a beautiful flower but have been the popular choice for both men and women for a tattoo since the 1930’s; but what does the rose symbolize.&nbsp; Your first thought may be in regard to its delicate beauty or its representation of love, inner and outer beauty and whilst you would be right there is also so much more to this beautiful flower.</p><p>As a depiction of love it can be a symbol of being in love particularly when the rose is without thorns, or with as a reminder that love does not come without certain sacrifices when the thorns are present. So even the thorns have their meaning, some say that when thorns are present on the tattoo it means the person does not place a great deal of emphasis on outer beauty, whilst for others, the tattoo refers to endless beauty with the thorn meaning you can look but you can’t touch.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo History</strong></p><p>The rose originated in Persia it is a masculine symbol, Over the years. It has become associated with femininity, however, the flower is popular with both men and women. Although the rose tattoo carries a plethora of meanings today, it used to only represent love.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Rose and Skull: </strong>The skull is a strong symbol of overcoming challenges or the death of an enemy. Combined with the rose, this tattoo is a representation of life after death—conquering an enemy and starting a new life. The most famous design depicts a rose growing out of a skull&#8217;s eye sockets. Some people like having the skull wearing the rose on its head.</li><li><strong>Anchor and Rose: </strong>This is a classic nautical tattoo that represents the commitment to a loved one.</li><li><strong>Rose and Dagger:</strong> These two contrasting elements can make for a visually striking tattoo that is imbued with profound meaning. The dagger stands for betrayal, ruthlessness, and death. A tattoo design that depicts a dagger stabbing a rose could represent the wearer&#8217;s belief that evil always conquers innocence. It could also symbolize heartbreak, especially if you add a few blood drops falling from a drooping rose. A dagger tattoo with rose vines wrapped around it represents the duality of human life and our constant struggle with good and evil. A tattoo of a rose&#8217;s thorny vines choking a dagger means that good always trumps evil or that true love is possible after a heartbreak.</li><li><strong>Rose and Clock:  </strong>A tattoo design that has a clock with no hands and a rose symbolizes endless love. Combined with the rose, this design could be a symbol of a certain romance in your past. Or it could represent an anniversary date.</li><li><strong>Rose and Dove:</strong> Dove tattoos are usually tributes to someone who has passed away. A rose and dove tattoo design can serve as a tribute to a loved one who has gone.</li></ul><p><strong>Symbol of balance</strong></p><p>A&nbsp;<strong>yellow rose</strong>&nbsp;symbolizes joy, protection against envious lovers, and a mature love.</p><p><strong>White roses</strong>&nbsp;symbolize purity, mysticism, and a secret admirer.</p><p><strong>Red roses </strong>symbolize romance or passionate love,&nbsp; also represent sacrifice or memorial.</p><p><strong>Pink roses</strong>&nbsp;are representative of healing, first love, and innocence.</p><p><strong>Blue roses</strong>&nbsp;signify the unattainable or the impossible.</p><p><strong>Black roses</strong>&nbsp;are a symbol of death and farewell. (This is not necessarily morbid; it can carry a message of a memorial.)</p><p>#tattoopins #botanicalflower #tattooartist #tattoomoscow #tattooinrussia #graphictattoo #wowtattoo #tattsketches #tattoodesign #moscowtattoo #equilattera #tattooselection #inkspiretattoos #womantattoo #taot #rostratattoo #tattooapprentice #tattooflash #sisterstattoo #sister #blackandgreytattoo #tattooshop #pinnacletattoo #colortattoo #weldertattoo #weldingtattoo #blackandgreysociety #blackandgreytattoos #customtattoos #skulltattoo</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/rose-tattoo/">Abstract Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Amazing Name Tattoo</strong></p><p>Tattoos are associated with drawings, but another trend is leading it toward more literary content. Lettering tattoos are not simple though.</p><p>Sometimes, words and names begin to be as obsessive that you need to keep them forever on your flesh: the first name of a loved one, a word that describes your rules of life, a sentence written by a talented writer/songwriter or something wise you wish could lead your path. Lettering is probably one of the most personal and meaningful type of a tattoo and that&#8217;s why it is very important to get the right design and tattoo artist. First, make sure to choose the best looking fonts: the size, spacing and readability are extremely important. Even if you want something very small, your tattoo has to be clear and readable from a good distance, or when aging it will completely be illegible.</p><p>Then, check the spelling more than twice with your artist and relatives. Don&#8217;t spend the rest of your life with one of those awful mistakes that you can see around the web. And finally, think it through: what could sound cool one moment is just painful, ridiculous or pointless later, especially if you&#8217;ve got the location wrong (no offensive words on your face, neck and hands please, be polite and act like a grown up). That is said, lettering allows all the fancies, associated with other elements, various fonts or creative tattoo style.</p><p>#nametattoo #lettertattoo #blacklettertattoo #NameInitialTattoo #lettertattoos #name #alphabet #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #anchortattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #letteringtattoo #liontattoo #skulltattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/amazing-name-tattoo/">Amazing Name Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feather tattoos are equally important among men and women because their symbolic meaning make them relevant for both the sexes. Feathers have commonly been used as tattoo designs since distant past and they have a deep-rooted, significant meaning associated with them, when used as tattoos, both among men and women. These designs continue to be popular and sought-after ones to date, between both sexes. Feathers have always been the object of fascination for human beings, as they are associated with birds, the exquisite flying creatures which stand for freedom, independence, triumph, and liberty, and these tattoos, which incorporate beautiful feather designs, symbolize the power of birds. In fact, feathers can not only add amazing beauty to a tattoo design but also give it an absolutely new meaning and significance for the bearer.</p><p><strong>The Symbolic Meaning of Feather Tattoos</strong></p><p>They are all about giving freedom to a person&#8217;s individuality and establishing him as an individual in his own right. In Native American culture, feathers were used as a protective talisman, which is the reason why these made an integral part of dreamcatchers, as a hanging on the bottom part, as they were considered effective for trapping bad dreams and negative energies, and providing protection from nightmares. The culture also regarded the feathers as a symbol of nature and revered them for the same reason.</p><p><strong>Cultural Significance of Feather Tattoos</strong></p><p>In Native American cultures, feathers represented the spirit of the birds they belonged to and these feathers were used by them in their ritualistic ceremonies, for the purpose of purifying and energizing the environment with their positive spiritual energies. The feathers of different birds had their own different meanings. For instance, eagle feathers were presented to warriors as they stood for bravery and courage, besides having the ability to help the recipient soar high in life, in worldly as well as spiritual sense. This is the reason these tattoos were seen mostly on the bodies of military forces. At the same time, these feathers were of tremendous spiritual value in Native American culture, representing wisdom and spiritual communication.</p><p>In some cultures, a fallen feather depicts a departed soul, while others take it as a sign of birth. It is also said that feathers stand for the communication of a person with the departed souls as they convey messages from the spirit world. Christianity has said about feathers being related to great virtues and an image of a signet ring bearing three feathers was symbolic of charity, faith, and hope, with each of the three feathers representing one of these virtues. In ancient Egypt, feathers were used in worshipping the Gods and a feather tattoo stood for the wisdom of the Egyptian Goddess Matt, the Goddess of truth and justice. It was believed that she compared the weight of the heart of the deceased with that of a feather while carrying out the mummification process. If the heart was as light as the feather, the soul was deemed as pure and the spirit was considered fit for further evolution and could move freely into the next phase of the afterlife. According to Celtic mythology, the people with superior powers wore cloaks adorned with feathers for some special ceremonies. In the legend, Morrigon wore a cloak of raven feathers to get transformed into a bird, which gave her the power of higher reasoning to understand the world in a better way. Like feather tattoos, Koi fish tattoos have their own cultural significance and historical background.</p><p>Besides the designs of feathers and the birds they come from, the color of the feathers have their symbolic meanings too. For instance, white stands for purity, yellow for smartness, and red for passion. Just like feathers are associated with spiritual heights, liberty, and freedom, feather tattoos are all about dreams, higher intelligence, and spiritually uplifting. They stand for the movement of the soul and the ability to float despite all kinds of obstacles.</p><p><strong>Feather Tattoo Designs</strong></p><p>As different birds have different types of feathers, there is an equally vast variety available in terms of tattoo designs for people to pick from. But this must be done after proper research about the deeper meaning to be signified by the feather tattoo. Besides the regular design of the feather tattoo, some modifications can go a long way in enhancing its beauty and overall look. There have been examples of the use of vivid colors and adornments such as beads to make these tattoos even more impressive.</p><p>Feather tattoos are equally important among men and women because their symbolic meaning makes them relevant for both sexes. While men love to have them adorned because they mean power, freedom, and strength, they look great on women too. When it comes to the exact placement of feather tattoos on the body, there are a number of options where these tattoos can look good. They can be adorned on the back, side, chest, arm, and foot.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/feather-tattoo-with-pearls/">Colorful Feather Tattoo with Pearls</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The butterfly is one of the prettiest and most popular elements that ladies choose to get inked. The pretty creature reminds us all that we’ve turned from a simple cocoon and emerged a resplendent, beautiful animal. They’re everyone’s favorite insect, and they make amazing tattoos.</p><p>In a recent study conducted over 1000 people in the US it turns out that when it comes to tattoos, women out number men. A total of 59% of women were found to have at least one tattoo versus only 41% with the men. With that in mind we’re going to take a look at one of the more popular tattoos among women – the butterfly tattoo.</p><p>Now we’re not saying that getting a butterfly tattooed on you us unmanly (well it kind of is) but it does go without saying that butterflies are one of the top designs chosen by women to get tattooed on themselves. Why is this? Well obviously they’re beautiful, but everyone knows that.</p><p>The butterfly also represents love, peace, flight and most of all transformation. Let’s remember that the butterfly starts out as a caterpillar and through time evolves in to the beautiful butterfly which we all know and love. This transformation is symbolic to a lot of women that have changed or grown from their past. Sometimes it is as simple as the change from girl to woman or maybe they have overcome a dark period in their life in the past – whatever it is, we don’t want to dig too deep in to the meaning behind it all, we just want to go ahead and show you our favorite butterfly tattoo designs.</p><p>#ButterflyTattoo #Butterfly #tattoo #tattoos #girlswithtattoos #tattooed #tattooartist #tattooart #tattooedgirls #guyswithtattoos #instatattoo #tattoolife #tattoodesign #traditionaltattoo #tattooflash #tattooist #tattoogirl #handtattoo #tattooedgirl #sleevetattoo #tattooing #tattooshop #blacktattoo #chesttattoo #tattoosofinstagram #rosetattoo #blackandgreytattoo #tattoomodel #tattooer #colortattoo #butterflies</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/butterfly-with-name-tattoo/">Butterfly with Name</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
