However, this is not a big surprise because the bird’s appearance is unique. It is rarely seen especially during the day. Mostly, it can be found at night, and therefore the beliefs can be many. It represents something precious that is not easily found but through a struggle and great search.</p><p>The owl tattoo is a complicated and beautiful work of design that is very much appealing to the eye. For a long time now, the owl tattoo symbolism is connected to education and wisdom.&nbsp;The Native Americans believe the owl to be the protector of sacred knowledge, hence regard it as a symbol of intelligence.</p><p><b>Symbol of freedom and vision</b></p><p>Just like the beliefs that birds are known to be free by flying wherever they please, the owl tattoo can symbolize freedom.</p><p>The owl with its big eyes is a great hunter. It is known to look for its food in an organized quiet manner even when flapping its wings. An owl tattoo will thus be used to symbolize vision.&nbsp;Weather forecasters of ancient times used the owl in their work. It was also useful in telling important weather conditions for different seasons.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/owl-tattoo-designs/">Owl Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
