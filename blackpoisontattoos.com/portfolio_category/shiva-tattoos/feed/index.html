										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of Hindu symbolism offers a treasure trove of imagery for meaningful tattoos. Among these, the Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo stands out as a powerful representation of inner transformation and spiritual guidance. This blog post delves into the symbolism behind this unique design, exploring its historical significance and potential interpretations for the modern wearer.</p><p><strong>The Dance of Destruction and Renewal</strong></p><p>Shiva, the Hindu god of transformation, is often depicted in the ecstatic dance of Tandava. This cosmic dance represents the continual cycle of creation, destruction, and renewal within the universe. The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo frequently features Shiva in this dynamic pose, his body adorned with serpents and flames, symbolizing the transformative power he wields.</p><p><strong>The Guiding Presence of the Rishi</strong></p><p>Juxtaposed against Shiva&#8217;s energetic dance is the serene figure of a Rishi, a wise sage or seer. The Rishi acts as a counterpoint to Shiva&#8217;s dynamism, representing the wisdom and guidance needed to navigate the transformative process. In the tattoo, the Rishi is often depicted in a meditative posture, offering a sense of grounding and spiritual insight.</p><p><strong>Unveiling the Layers of Meaning</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo resonates with wearers on multiple levels. Here&#8217;s a deeper look at the symbolism it embodies:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Transformation and Rebirth:</strong> Shiva&#8217;s dance signifies the constant change inherent in life. By incorporating this image, the wearer acknowledges their own journey of growth and transformation.</li>

<li><strong>Inner Power and Destruction of Ego:</strong> The flames surrounding Shiva represent the burning away of illusion and ego. The tattoo serves as a reminder of the potential for immense inner power that lies within each of us.</li>

<li><strong>Seeking Guidance and Wisdom:</strong> The Rishi embodies the wisdom and knowledge needed to navigate life&#8217;s challenges. The tattoo signifies the wearer&#8217;s openness to guidance and spiritual growth.</li>

<li><strong>Balance and Duality:</strong> The contrasting figures of Shiva and the Rishi represent the inherent duality within the universe – destruction and creation, chaos and order. The tattoo serves as a reminder of the importance of finding balance within oneself.</li></ul><p><strong>Beyond Symbolism: Personal Interpretations</strong></p><p>The beauty of the Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo lies in its ability to hold personal meaning for the wearer. Some interpretations include:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>A Commitment to Spiritual Growth:</strong> The tattoo can symbolize a dedication to self-discovery and a willingness to embrace life&#8217;s transformative experiences.</li>

<li><strong>Overcoming Challenges:</strong> It can represent the courage to face inner demons and emerge stronger from difficult times.</li>

<li><strong>Honoring Lineage and Tradition:</strong> The Rishi can signify a connection to one&#8217;s spiritual lineage or a particular guru who has offered guidance.</li></ul><p><strong>Considering the Design</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo can be rendered in various artistic styles, from traditional Hindu art forms like Kolam or Madhubani to contemporary black and grey or vibrant illustrative styles. The choice of style ultimately depends on the wearer&#8217;s personal preferences and the desired level of detail.</p><p><strong>Placement and Size</strong></p><p>The size and placement of the tattoo can also hold significance. A larger, more elaborate design on the back or chest can represent a deep commitment to the symbolism, while a smaller, more discreet piece on the arm or ankle might offer a more personal reminder.</p><p><strong>Finding the Right Artist</strong></p><p>Given the intricate nature of the design, choosing a skilled tattoo artist with experience in Hindu iconography is crucial. Look for an artist who can capture the essence of the symbolism and translate it into a visually stunning and culturally respectful tattoo.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: A Powerful Talisman for Inner Transformation</strong></p><p>The Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi tattoo is more than just a decorative piece of body art. It&#8217;s a powerful symbol that can serve as a constant reminder of the transformative potential within each of us. By understanding the rich symbolism behind this design, you can embark on a journey of self-discovery and embrace the power of inner transformation.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/shiva-rishi-tattoo/">Trance of Shiva &amp; Rishi Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Introduction</h2><p>Have you ever gazed upon the image of a female devotee of Lord Shiva, holding the sacred damru in her hand? It&#8217;s a sight that not only captures the eye but also stirs the soul. In this article, we delve into the enchanting world of spirituality, symbolism, and devotion, as we explore the profound connection between a female devotee of Lord Shiva and the rhythmic beat of the damru.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-the-symbolism-of-lord-shiva-and-damru">2. The Symbolism of Lord Shiva and Damru</h2><p>Imagine the divine dance of Lord Shiva, the cosmic dancer whose every move echoes creation and destruction. The damru, a small hourglass-shaped drum, is an extension of his rhythm. With every beat, it signifies the pulse of existence—the beginning and end of life&#8217;s cycles. In the hands of a female devotee, the damru takes on new meaning. It embodies the duality of life—gentleness and strength, creation and destruction—much like a woman&#8217;s multifaceted nature.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-embracing-the-feminine-divine">3. Embracing the Feminine Divine</h2><p>The depiction of a female devotee with a damru is a testament to the inclusive nature of spirituality. It acknowledges the profound presence of the feminine divine—the cosmic energy that nurtures and sustains all life. In a world often dominated by masculine symbolism, this imagery reminds us of the balance and harmony that exist within the universe, represented by both genders.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-the-spiritual-dance-of-creation-and-destruction">4. The Spiritual Dance of Creation and Destruction</h2><p>Just as Lord Shiva&#8217;s dance symbolizes the eternal rhythm of creation and destruction, the damru&#8217;s sound represents the primordial vibration that birthed the cosmos. As a female devotee holds the damru, she partakes in this cosmic dance. With each rhythmic shake, she aligns herself with the forces that shape existence, embracing change as an integral part of life&#8217;s journey.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-the-rhythmic-melody-of-cosmic-energy">5.

The beats echo through time, connecting us to the past, present, and future. When a female devotee holds the damru, she becomes a vessel for this cosmic melody, a conduit through which the energy of the universe flows.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-nurturing-balance-in-life-s-tumultuous-seas">6. Nurturing Balance in Life&#8217;s Tumultuous Seas</h2><p>Life is a journey of highs and lows, storms and calms. The damru&#8217;s dual-sided nature—the balance of creation and destruction—mirrors life&#8217;s challenges and triumphs. In the hands of a female devotee, the damru becomes a source of strength, reminding her to find equilibrium amidst chaos and to embrace every phase of life with grace.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-channeling-energy-through-devotion">7. Channeling Energy Through Devotion</h2><p>Devotion is a potent force. When a female devotee holds the damru, her devotion channels divine energy. The drum&#8217;s beat becomes an expression of her love and reverence for Lord Shiva, magnifying the connection between the devotee and the divine. This shared heartbeat transcends words, creating a profound communion.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-the-meditative-power-of-damru-s-sound">8. The Meditative Power of Damru&#8217;s Sound</h2><p>The damru&#8217;s rhythm has a mesmerizing quality that can induce a meditative state. As a female devotee holds the damru, its sound reverberates within her, leading her into a tranquil realm of introspection. The gentle resonance of the drum merges with her heartbeat, allowing her to explore the depths of her consciousness.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-9-uniting-with-the-universe">9. Uniting with the Universe</h2><p>In the hands of a female devotee, the damru becomes a bridge between the individual and the cosmos. It symbolizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the unity of creation. As she holds the damru, she aligns herself with the divine dance of existence, embracing her role in the grand tapestry of life.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-conclusion">10. Conclusion</h2><p>The image of a female devotee holding a damru is a poignant reminder of the intricate relationship between spirituality, gender, and the universe. It encapsulates the essence of balance, devotion, and cosmic unity. Just as the damru&#8217;s sound resonates far and wide, so does the profound message it carries—the interconnectedness of all life forms, the rhythm of existence, and the enduring dance of creation and destruction.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs">FAQs</h2><p><strong>What is the significance of the damru in Hindu mythology?</strong></p><p>The damru, a small drum, is a symbol of the cosmic rhythm of creation and destruction in Hindu mythology.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Om and Its Meaning in Hinduism</strong></p><p>As we mentioned before, the Om symbol has various meanings and uses throughout Hinduism. Now, we will have a look at some of the most common and well-known meanings of the Om symbol in the religion.</p><p>According to Hindu beliefs, “the essence of all beings on earth, the essence of earth is water, the essence of water are plants, the essence of plants are men, the essence of men is the speech, the essence of speech is the Rig Veda, the essence of the Rig Veda is the Sama Veda, and the essence of Sama Veda is Om.”</p><p>The older Upanishads also state that the Om symbol represents the struggle between the gods and demons. This is not actually meant to represent true gods and demons, but the inclinations of good and evil within humans. In other words, it is allegorical in nature.</p><p>Also, the Om symbol is implied to be that thing in humans which inspires good and altruistic actions and thoughts.</p><p>On a side note, within the Mandukya Upanishad, Om is mentioned as “the syllable of the whole world.”</p><p>In the first verse of this Upanishad, it states that time is made of three parts. The past, present, and future, or in other words A, U, and M.</p><p>Subsequent verses suggest that the Om is something like an “acknowledgment. A melodic confirmation, and something that gives energy to a hymn”.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/om-tattoo/">Om Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiva (Sanskrit: Auspicious One), or Siva, is one of the main Deities of Hinduism, worshiped as the paramount lord by the Saivite sects of India. Shiva is one of the most complex gods of India, embodying seemingly contradictory qualities. He is the destroyer and the restorer, the great ascetic and the symbol of sensuality, the benevolent herdsman of souls and the wrathful avenger.Shiva was originally known as Rudra, a minor deity addressed only three times in the Rig Veda.</p><p>He gained importance after absorbing some of the characteristics of an earlier fertility god and became Shiva, part of the Trinity, or Trimurti, with Vishnu and Brahma.Shiva is &#8216;shakti&#8217; or power, Shiva is the destroyer, the most powerful god of the Hindu.

Hindus recognize this by putting his shrine in the temple separate from those of other deities.</p><p><strong>The Cult of Shiva</strong></p><p>Shaivism, or Saivism, is one of the most popular Hindu cults. It embraces many theological practices, although all agree on three principles: pati. or God; pasu, or individual soul; and pasa, or bonds that confine the soul to earthly existence. The aim of Shaivites is to rid their souls of bondage and achieve shivata, the &#8220;nature of Shiva&#8221;. They achieve this through ascetic practices and penances, with an emphasis on yoga and renunciation. Many Shaivites become wandering sadhus or hold men. Shiavites mark their foreheads with three horizontal marks representing the three aspects of Shiva.</p><p>&#8220;Shiva often wears a snake coiled around his upper arms and neck symbolizing the power he has over the most deadly of creatures.&#8221;</p><p>Shiva often wears a snake coiled around his upper arms and neck symbolizing the power.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The power or energy of Shiva is Parvati. Shiva&#8217;s first wife was Sati and his second wife was Parvati. Both are the forms of Adhi Shakti. They are also known by many other names, such as Uma, Gauri, Durga, Kali, Annapurna and Shakti. He is known by many names and tittles. As a god of anger, He is Rudra, the Red One, feared by one and all. As Kailasapathi, He is the Lord of Kailash, His Abode in the Himalayas. As Purusha, He is Iswara Himself. As the Lord of the beings, He is known as Pasupathinath. His sons are Ganesha and Kartikeya. Shiva taught Parvati , Vedanta (transcendent knowledge), while Parvati tought him Sankhya (cosmological knowledge). Both are perfected yogis.</p><p><strong>The Shiva Lingam</strong></p><p>Lord Shiva is conceived in his unborn, invisible form as the Shiva Lingam. The Lingam represents the male creative energy of Shiva. This main symbol of Shiva is worshipped in virtually every Hindu temple and home. Through profound understanding of this symbol, the mystery of creation can be understood as an act of love.</p><p>When Ganga incarnated on Earth, Lord Shiva captured her in His hair mat to stop Her from flooding the earth. As the bearer of the sacred river Ganges, He is known as Ganagadhar. Because of His matted hair, He is dearly called as Jatadhari, by His ascetic followers. As a perfect being He is Siddheshwar. With His Trident in His hands, He became popular as heroic and fearless Trisuladhari. As the world teacher, He was eulogized as Dakhshinamurthi by Adi Shankara in his famous book, &#8220;Hymns to Dakhshinamurthi&#8221;. The fact that a great mass of heterogeneous cults and practices came to be associated with Him, suggests that in His unlimited wisdom and boundless love as a World Teacher and Father of all, Lord Shiva, gives immense freedom to His followers to choose whatever path they want to follow for their self-realization.</p><p>Shiva worshippers (Shaivites) are among India&#8217;s most ascetic Sadhus and yogis, their body smeared with ashes, dressed in saffron colors and wearing a Rudraksha mala. The path of Shiva can thus be seen as the inward-going path, the great journey to find the inner self and self-realization.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> #LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/realistic-lord-shiva-tattoo/">Realistic Lord Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Lord Shiva with Chillum Tattoo</strong></p><p>In Hindu mythology there are various forms of meditations and different paths for yogis but Shiva represents the art of meditation in its most absolute form. In meditation, not only mind is made still but everything is dropped. In deep meditation or Samadhi, even the object of the meditation (like a mantra, Tantra or Yantra) is transformed into its formless essence, which is the essence of absoluteness and &#8220;Purna&#8221;(completeness). Thus Shiva stands for letting go everything in the world of forms. The path of Lord Shiva is undoubtedly the path of the ascetic yogi.</p><p><strong>Forms of Shiva</strong></p><p>Shiva has different forms: The first being Aghora (which resides in the cremation grounds), then Ishana (most often appears as the Shivalingam), the third being &#8220;Tat Purusha&#8221; where He is meditating, then Varna Deva (the eternally auspicious Shiva) and then Sadyojat or Braddha Rudra (the old wrathful form). The last also forms of the Lord has the deepest connection to the Rudrakshas and Rudrakshas mala &#8211; a rosary made of the dried fruits of the Rudraksha tree. Shiva has different forms: The first being Aghora (which resides in the cremation grounds), then Ishana (most often appears as the Shivalingam), the third being &#8220;Tat Purusha&#8221; where He is meditating, then Varna Deva (the eternally auspicious Shiva) and then Sadyojat or Braddha Rudra (the old wrathful form).The last also forms of the Lord has the deepest connection to the Rudrakshas and Rudrakshas mala &#8211; a rosary made of the dried fruits of the Rudraksha tree.</p><p>Yet another form is the Nataraj, where the Lord Shiva Nataraj&#8217;s dance implies both the destruction and the creation of the universe and reveals the cycles of death, birth and rebirth. His Dance of Bliss is for the welfare of the world. In the pose of Nataraj, the King of Dance is giving darshan to his beloved devotees within the &#8220;Hall of Consciousness&#8221;, which is the heart of the human. Under his feet, Shiva crushes the demon of ignorance called Apasmara Purusha, caused by forgetfulness. One hand is stretched across his chest and points towards the uplifted foot, indicating the release from earthly bondage of the devotee. The fire represents the final destruction of creation, but the dance of the Nataraj is also an act of creation, which arouses dormant energies and scatters the ashes of the universe in a pattern that will be the design of the ensuing creation.</p><p>Then in His Mahamrityunyaya form, Lord Shiva is depicted as the great conqueror of death and giver of immortality. The Mahamrityunjaya mantra is one of the two main mantras of the Vedas, next to the Gayatri mantra. It is chanted to eradicate death and disease.</p><p>Another main form of Shiva is Ardhnarishwara, half Shiva, half Shakti.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> #LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-shiva-with-chillum/">Lord Shiva with Chillum</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

The tranquil-looking lord can turn into a destroyer, and can also be a bholenath. He has multiple shades to his personality, and is one god who can truly teach us the wisdom to live life.</p><p>Lord Shiva was known as the destroyer of evil. He couldn&#8217;t tolerate injustice and destroyed the evil rakshasas in a fair manner. Similarly, even we should try to keep zero tolerance for the evil happening around us and take a stand against injustice.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> #LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/roaring-lord-shiva-tattoo/">Roaring Lord Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

This divine art form is performed by Lord Shiva and his divine consort Goddess Parvati. The dance performed by Lord Shiva is known as Tandava.

The dance is a pictorial allegory of the five principle manifestations of eternal energy &#8211; creation, destruction, preservation, salvation, and illusion.</p><p>According to learned scholar, Coomerswamy, the dance of Shiva also represents his five activities namely,</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>′Shrishti′ &#8211; creation, evolution</li><li>′Sthiti′ &#8211; preservation, support</li><li>′Samhara′ &#8211; destruction, evolution</li><li>′Tirobhava′ &#8211; illusion</li><li>′Anugraha′ &#8211; release, emancipation, grace</li></ul><p><strong>Tags:</strong>&nbsp;#LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/dancing-shiva-tattoo/">Dancing Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

The Linga, a sign of masculinity, symbolises Shiva’s role in the creation, sustainance and withdrawal of the Universe.</p><p><strong>The Avatars of Lord Shiva</strong></p><p>Lord Shiva, similar to Lord Vishnu, had many avatars. It was Virabhadra, an avatar of Lord Shiva, who disrupted Daksha’s yajna and cut off his head. His Bhairava avatar, also known as Kaal Bhairava, was created to protect the Sati Pind. His Durvasa avatar was famous for his short temper. Khandoba was another avatar of Shiva known in Maharashtrian and Kannada cultures.

He is depicted with an ambivalent nature when worshipped by the Hindus as their supreme God. He is mentioned in the Yajurveda as possessing both malignant and auspicious attributes. He is depicted in the Mahabharata as a figure of honour, delight, and brilliance. The Rudra form of Lord Shiva denotes “the wild one” or the fierce god.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoo of Lord Shiva in Meditation</p><p><strong>Lord Shiva the Enigmatic</strong></p><p>According to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva is the Destroyer in the Holy Trinity, the others being Brahma the Creator and Vishnu the Preserver. He has always fascinated his followers by his unique appearance – he has not two but three eyes, has ash smeared all over his body, leads a wild life away from social pretences, and is known for his proverbial anger…but not many know the story about how he was born…</p><p><strong>So, how was Shiva born?</strong></p><p>There is a very interesting story behind the birth of Lord Shiva. One day, Brahma and Vishnu were both arguing about which of them was more powerful. Right then, one great blazing pillar appeared, whose roots and branches extended into the earth and sky, beyond view.</p><p><strong>The Third Power</strong></p><p>Both Brahma and Vishnu set out to locate the start and end of that pillar. Brahma turned into a goose and flew up to find the top of the pillar, while Vishnu turned into a boar and dug into the earth to look for its roots. After their unsuccessful attempt, both came back to find Lord Shiva emerging from an opening in the pillar. Recognising Shiva’s great power, they both accepted that besides them, there was a third power ruling over the universe.</p><p><strong>Lord Shiva’s Lifestyle</strong></p><p>But Lord Shiva is no ordinary god. He is a very complex god, having many roles to play and possessing immense power. His favourite haunt are cemeteriesand his favourite dress code is a headdress of snakes and a necklace of skulls. He is accompanied by a band of terrifying looking demons, who are blood-thirsty as well.</p><p><strong>Lord Shiva’s Meditative Powers</strong></p><p>Though Shiva is known better as a ferocious god, he has another side too – he is known to spend long periods of time in deep meditation in the lofty Himalayas.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong>&nbsp;#LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-shiva-in-meditation/">Lord Shiva in Meditation</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Rudraksha, the necklace worn by Lord Shiva shows that he is firm about his cosmic laws and to maintain law and order in the universe. The necklace has 108 beads, which symbolize the elements used in the creation of the world.</p><p>Damaru (Drum): A small drum with two sides alienated from each other by a thin neck-like structure represents the two utterly different states of existence, unclear and clear. When a damaru is shaken, the sound formed denotes Nada, the cosmic sound of AUM, which can be heard during deep meditation.</p><p>Trishul (Trident): A three-branched trident shown adjoining Lord Shiva symbolizes His three fundamental powers will, action and knowledge. As a weapon, the trident represents the instrument of punishment to the evil doer on all three planes &#8211; spiritual, subtle, and physical.</p><p>Nandi, the Bull: Nandi is said to be the vehicle of Lord Shiva. The bull represents both power and ignorance. Lord Shiva′s use of the bull as his vehicle expresses the idea that He removes ignorance and bequeaths power of wisdom to His followers.</p><p>We have a large portfolio of <a href="/portfolio_category/lord-shiva-tattoos/">Shiva Tattoos</a>.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong>&nbsp;#LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-shiva-tattoo-with-chillum/">Lord Shiva Tattoo with Chillum</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Also spelled, &#8216;trishul&#8217; or &#8216;trisula&#8217;, it comes from the Sanskrit language where tri means &#8216;three&#8217; and shula means &#8216;spear&#8217;.</p><p>The Trishula has come to symbolize several important &#8216;triads&#8217;. First, there is the Hindu trinity of deities &#8211; Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. It also stands for the aspects and powers associated with these gods &#8212; Creation, Preservation and Destruction.</p><p>The three feminine (shakti) powers of will, action, and wisdom are also symbolized by the Trishula.</p><p>Three more symbols of the design are desire, will, and love.</p><p>Not to be overlooked, are the the trishula design&#8217;s potent symbolism of past, present and future. In Buddhism, the Trishula is symbolic of the Three Jewels &#8211; right knowledge, right belief, right action. In the Tibetan tradition, it is a magical weapon carried by the protective deities in their battles with evil forces.</p><p>As a weapon it is also associated with the goddess, Durga, one of Shiva&#8217;s many consorts. She brandishes it in one of her seven hands as she ferociously takes on enemy demons. A Hindu myth describes Shiva striking his son with the trishula, the power of the weapon so great that it sent the lad&#8217;s head flying so far it could not be found.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong>&nbsp;#LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-shivas-trishul-damru-snake-tattoo/">Trishul, Damru &#038; Snake Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
