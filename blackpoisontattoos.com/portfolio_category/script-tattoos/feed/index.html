The Trishul: A Symbol of Divine Power</h2><p>The trishul, a three-pronged spear, holds immense significance in Hindu mythology. Representing the trinity of creation, preservation, and destruction &#8211; Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva &#8211; it symbolizes the balance of cosmic forces. The trishul&#8217;s sharp edges depict the triumph of good over evil and the power to conquer obstacles.

Chanting it instills courage and grants inner peace.

Each stroke of the tattoo artist&#8217;s needle becomes a brushstroke of spiritual expression.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-the-pain-and-pleasure-of-getting-a-hand-tattoo">6.

It&#8217;s like donning a spiritual armor that emboldens you to face life fearlessly.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-9-the-allure-of-hand-tattoos-in-modern-culture">9.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve spent months deciding on the right tattoo, and finally, it&#8217;s time to get inked. You&#8217;re excited and nervous, but one question remains: What is the best place to put your new tattoo? Should it be on your arm or your chest? An ankle or back? The answer is simple: any place you want! Well&#8230; maybe not literally any spot—you probably don&#8217;t want to get a giant portrait of your ex on your forehead. But generally speaking, there are no hard-and-fast rules about where you should get tattooed. That said, there are some considerations that may make certain locations more appealing than others for different people; this article will help guide you through those considerations so that when you choose where to get inked, it&#8217;ll be an experience that makes both you and whoever gets to see it happy!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-persist-tattoo-meaning">Persist Tattoo Meaning</h4><p>The meaning behind the Persist tattoo is to keep going, keep trying and keep fighting. It means that no matter what happens in life it&#8217;s important to stay positive and move forward.</p><p>Persistence is a character trait that some people have but others don&#8217;t. The Persist tattoo means that you&#8217;re a person who will never give up on what they want in their life and will work hard towards getting it.</p><p>If you&#8217;re struggling to make something happen with your life and are wondering how to persist, get this phrase tattooed on yourself!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-has-to-be-something-that-feels-important-to-you-and-your-life">It has to be something that feels important to you and your life.</h4><p>A script tattoo is one that has meaning, and it&#8217;s essential to take the time to find a design that makes sense for you. It has to be something that feels important to you and your life. You don&#8217;t want a tattoo just because it looks cool or other people have them—it&#8217;s got to be something that will make sense with your personality and lifestyle.</p><p>It also has to be something that fits into your long-term plans: &#8220;I&#8217;m going through this phase right now,&#8221; or &#8220;My dad wants me not having tattoos&#8221; are NOT good reasons for getting a script tattoo! If you&#8217;re looking at getting something specific in mind then talk about why this particular phrase/word would best fit what you want in a piece of art on your body forever! Make sure there&#8217;s no regret later down the road!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-script-tattoo">Script Tattoo</h4><p>The Persist Script Tattoo is the perfect script tattoo for those who are fans of the word “persist”. The word itself means to continue doing something even when it seems impossible, and this tattoo represents that perfectly. If you want a tattoo that can help you stay motivated, then this is the one for you!</p><p>Persist Word Tattoo Meaning</p><p>The meaning behind this word makes it even more important than others in our opinion as it reminds people to always keep going no matter what happens in life. This single word has helped many people get through some very difficult times, so we think it’s important to carry on those traditions by passing them along yourself!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-couple-tattoo">Couple Tattoo</h4><p>Couple Tattoo Meaning</p><p>With the help of the internet, you can get a lot of ideas for couple of tattoos. You may have seen some on Instagram, Pinterest, or other social media sites and wondered what their meaning is or how to get one yourself. It&#8217;s important that you ask yourself why you want to get a tattoo with your partner before getting one together. Couple tattoos are very popular and can mean various things depending on who gets them and what they look like. Some people think that they represent love in its purest form while others associate them with marriage; however, there are many more meanings associated with couple tattoos than just these two interpretations!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>Now that you know about the meaning of these tattoos, you can start searching for one that reflects your personality and beliefs. If you want a tattoo for an important value or belief, then we suggest taking the time to learn more about these ideas before deciding on what design will work best for you. With so many beautiful styles available today it doesn&#8217;t have to be difficult to find one that suits your interests.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/persist-script-tattoo/">Persist Script Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Rose tattoos will never get old. </strong></p><p>They stand for a timeless <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">beauty</a> that never fades and, if done right, never fails to delight. Rose Tattoo</p><p>There are many myths and legends surrounding the creation of the rose. Its beauty, its fragrance, even the thorns have stories that explain the conception of this glorious flower. These rose tattoos are awesome embodiments of humans&#8217; constant attraction to a flower that has had everyone smitten since the dawn of time.</p><p>It was a symbol of love and beauty associated with the goddess, but also came to stand for secrecy after Cupid offered a rose to the God of Silence to keep quiet Venus’s affairs. In fact, Roman dining room ceilings were decorated with roses to urge guests to keep quiet about what was said at dinner, and “sub rosa” or “under the rose” still means “confidentially” today.&#8221;</p><p>The traditional red rose tattoo symbolizes love and passion. A pink rose represents grace, gratitude, and affection while purple roses have been used to symbolize royalty and enchantment.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><p>Thus, for instance, in Greece this flower symbolized the blood of Aphrodite, in Rome it has been connected with the goddess Diana, who has transformed her lover into a rose, in Egypt it was a favorite flower of Isis, in Christian countries the rose has been associated with the blood of Christ. In the East, this flower was the sign of pure and sincere love.</p><p>In the current world, the denotation of the rose depends on its color and it doesn’t matter where the tattoo will be placed.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A black rose denotes tragic love, various subcultures invest their own meaning. Hence, for example, goths reckon that the black rose is death, for anarchists the same symbol is the fight.</li><li>A white rose shows pure love and a faithful essence of its owner.</li><li>A red rose indicates passion, desire, and love, whereas a burgundy rose spells out the idea of inner harmony.</li><li>A blue rose represents a sophisticated nature of a human, who wears it. He or she renounces all rules and foundations, adopted in the society, besides, this person strives for something unattainable.</li><li>A yellow rose has altered its meaning: at first, it meant jealousy, but now it connotes dedication.</li><li>An orange rose conveys that the owner is enthusiastic and attractive.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/rose-tattoo-3/">Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/"><strong>Scorpion Tattoos are not that mainstream, they are popular. They are mainly worn by men, but some women may like them as well.</strong></a></p><p>Scorpions are among the most dangerous creatures on Earth. They&#8217;re also beautiful, so why not add a little bit of danger to your body art? Scorpion tattoos are popular for both men and women.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-black-scorpion">The Black Scorpion</h4><p>The black scorpion tattoo design has been used by people for centuries. It&#8217;s one of the oldest symbols known to man. This symbol represents strength, power, and protection.</p><p>A scorpion tattoo represents the traits and attributes of the scorpion. Someone who gets this arachnid tatted on their body might want to send the message that they are deadly, stealthy, and not to be messed with. In addition to representing the scorpion&#8217;s characteristics, this tat could also be a symbol of a variety of other meanings, such as the zodiac sign Scorpio.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">scorpion and rose tattoo</a> represents two living things that are not to be judged by their covers. The scorpion is small, yet intimidating, and the rose is beautiful but can hurt someone with its thorns. Both the scorpion and the rose should be admired from a distance. Getting a tattoo with a scorpion and rose means that you are someone. Who cannot be judged and that people should be wary when trying to get close to you. Either physically or spiritually. A scorpion with a rose tail could mean that you are a double-edged sword. You can sting, but you can also be pleasant.</p><p>Scorpion and rose tattoos convey to others that living things should not be judged by their appearances. Even though both are very beautiful, both the scorpion and the rose can bring about great pain and should be admired from afar. Those with scorpions and roses tattooed on their body send a message to others that it may be difficult to get emotionally or physically too close to them.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/scorpio-tattoo/">Best Scorpion Tattoo Design of All Time</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palms-together is beautiful in religion.We close eyes during prayer is to quiet the mind while two hands placed together is to quiet the physical body. I remember there is a sentence is “When the mind and hands are silenced the spirit is more focused”. There are many different meanings staying inside each tattoo. We have it to commemorate a member of the family, a relative, a friend or a person you admire who passed away. We have it to mark and raise ourselves up in hard periods in our life. Sometimes, we have it to just praying for the happiness and the health of our family. In general, the religious belief and comfort are what people aim in life.</p><p>God gave a gift to the world when you were born&#8230;Praying Hands In God&#8217;s hands lies a heart, a life that changed the world&nbsp;<strong>Praying hands symbolize obedience, submission, sincerity, repentance, veneration, and respect in regard to one&#8217;s higher power.</strong> The exact meaning of praying hands varies depending on which religious tradition is considered.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><strong>Praying hands tattoos Design Variations of the Tattoo</strong></a></p><p>The praying hands tattoo works well alone. But many people like to stylize the image to their own artistic likes and dislikes. As well as their own beliefs.</p><p>There are hundreds of reasons why people have a tattoo such as falling in love, separating in love. Having religion, showing personality and so on. Coming to the market of tattoos today, you will be shocked by its diversity and you as well will be easy to take a fancy to own one. If you really want to take it and you are pious, praying hands tattoo may be a good choice for you. In the world of religious tattoos, this one is sparkling like a star. In my mind, praying hands is a beautiful and meaningful tattoo.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/praying-hands-tattoo/">Praying Hands Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Getting any type of ink is a big commitment, especially if you are getting it with someone. Getting a <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">tattoo</a> with someone else is serious business, so you want to make sure that you both love it. Sisters always have a strong bond and a tattoo can be a symbol of that bond. A sister’s bond is unbreakable, you know that and you want to share that. A sister can be so much more than a family member. A sister can be your best friend, a confidant, and your one true soul mate.</p><p>By getting a tattoo with your sister, you can strengthen the bond of friendship and love so much more. It’s a great way to show your love. There is a lot of meaning in matching tattoos. If you want to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><span class="s1">symbolize your </span></a><span class="s1">sisterhood</span>, then try out a matching tattoo design.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mahamrityunjaya Mantra is one among the oldest and most important Mantra in Indian mythology and spirituality. This mantra belongs to Lord Shiva. It is a combination of three Hindi language words i.e. ‘Maha’, which means great, ‘Mrityun’ means death and ‘Jaya’ means victory, which turns into conqueror victory over death.It is also known as ‘Rudra Mantra’ or ‘Trayambakam Mantra’. The Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra is said to have been created by Rishi Markandeya. The Moon was once in trouble, cursed by King Daksha. Rishi Markandeya gave the Mahamritryunjaya Mantra to Sati, Daksha&#8217;s daughter, for the Moon.</p><p><strong>Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra Tattoo</strong></p><p>Meaning of the mantra</p><p><span class="s1">त्रयम्बकं</span> <span class="s1">यजामहे</span> <span class="s1">सुगन्धिं</span> <span class="s1">पुष्टिवर्धनम्</span> <span class="s2">।</span> <span class="s1">उर्वारुकमिव</span> <span class="s1">बन्धनान्</span> <span class="s1">म्रुत्योर्मुक्षिय</span> <span class="s1">मामृतात्</span> <span class="s2">॥</span> Om Trayambakam Yajamahe, Sugandhim Pushti Vardhanam, Urvarukmiv Bandhanat, Mrityurmokshaya Mamratat.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Until the very end&#8221; is a quote from Deathly Hallows. Harry&#8217;s walking to his death and uses the Resurrection Stone to bring back the people who meant the most to him. When he asks if they&#8217;ll stay with him, James replies, &#8220;Until the very end.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Harry Potter Tattoos</strong></p><p>The Deathly Hallows symbol is a simple representation of the Deathly Hallows artifacts: the Elder Wand, the resurrection stone and the invisibility cloak. The symbol consists of triangle, with a circle inside it. A straight line bisects the circle and the top of the triangle.</p><p><strong>The triangle represents the cloak; the circle represents the resurrection stone; and the straight line represents the Elder Wand.</strong></p><p>. The brothers are skilled wizards who unite their powers to cross a river, where Death usually claims victims. Death schemes to trick them by offering each a gift. The eldest brother asks for an unbeatable wand, the second brother asks for the power to raise the dead, and the final brother asks for an invisibility cloak. Death claims the first two brothers, but the youngest brother lives until he is ready to take off the cloak and reveal himself to Death.</p><p>The Hallows united would supposedly make the person who owns them the master of Death itself. The myth, as Hermione reads it in&nbsp;<i>Beedle the Bard</i>, has a basis in fact. The three Peverell brothers, according to Dumbledore, were exceedingly talented magicians who created the objects themselves.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/harry-potter-tattoos/">Until The Very End Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celtic knot is a popular Celtic symbol using a knot which has no beginning and no end. Each loop through it is individual is part of the whole and cannot be separated&nbsp;as the relationship between father and daughter.The Celtic symbol for father-daughter tells the story of Brigid who sat close to her dying father. As she waited she weaved a knot from rushes. Her father noticed and asked her what she was doing. She explained how each loop, although the individual is not able to be separated from the whole just as their relationship was interwoven so too, were they wrapped up with those who would follow in the life after.</p><p><span class="keyword"><strong>Celtic knot tattoo</strong></span></p><p>You&#8217;ve probably heard that having a strong male influence is important in a young boy&#8217;s life. But it&#8217;s equally important for daughters to have one as well. A positive father-daughter relationship can have a huge impact on a young girl&#8217;s life. And even determine whether or not she develops into a strong, confident woman.</p><p>A father&#8217;s influence in his daughter&#8217;s life shapes her self-esteem, self-image, confidence, and opinions of men.</p><p>It seems like no matter how much tattoo styles and trends evolve over time. There will always be a few classic categories that have a constant stream of loyal fans. The Celtic swirls and designs. So often seen on traditional Irish jewelry and on our ancient manuscripts in museums like the lettering and illustrations seen. Within The Book Of Kells have always proved very popular as tattoos both in men and women alike. Their striking lines and interwoven shapes make a great visual impact, and they lend themselves easily to adaptation,&nbsp;becoming an upper arm cuff, a broader back piece, or even as a delicate self-contained symbol the size of a Post-It. You’ll find their popularity soar even higher beyond these green shores, as many who might have Irish family connections will often get a Celtic design to reflect their cultural heritage. As well as these cultural &amp; historical reasons, it could also be far simpler; some folks just like the look of ‘em. Here we are going to take a look at Celtic knotwork and more specifically the Father-Daughter Knot.</p><p><strong>The symbolic meanings attached to knotwork may or may not have any truth to their historical basis though and is not concrete as there are no written records of what the various Celtic knots were originally created for.</strong></p><p>They are also symbols that can show us how we are all part of a never-ending cycle of life. Where we each add our particular strand in the fabric of time and space.</p><p>These designs are not only exquisite and beautiful&#8230;they also compel the beholder to ascribe the knot. Meaning even though the Celtic knot meanings may or may not have any historical basis in fact, and their meanings lie in the eyes of their creators. The symbolic meanings are however abstract in the sense that they relate to the universe and life rather than human emotions or the relationships we have with one another.</p><p>The endless strands indicate the bonds that tie us together and as each generation passes. The weave gets stronger and larger as this happens the Celtic knot patterns get more complex. The strands begin to bring themselves back on one another; much like the forthcoming generations will continue to bring the next chapter of generations after that.</p><p>Discover more <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio_category/tattoo-designs/">Tattoo Designs</a> here.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/celtic-knot-tattoo/">Father and Daughter Tattoo &#8211; Celtic Knot Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos are associated with drawings, but another trend is leading it toward more literary content. Lettering tattoos are not simple though.</p><p>Sometimes, words and names begin to be as obsessive that you need to keep them forever on your flesh: the first name of a loved one, a word that describes your rules of life, a sentence written by a talented writer/songwriter or something wise you wish could lead your path. Lettering is probably one of the most personal and meaningful type of a tattoo and that’s why it is very important to get the right design and tattoo artist. First, make sure to choose the best looking fonts: the size, spacing and readability are extremely important. Even if you want something very small, your tattoo has to be clear and readable from a good distance. When aging it will completely be illegible.</p><p>Then, check the spelling more than twice with your artist and relatives. Don’t spend the rest of your life with one of those awful mistakes that you can see around the web. And finally, think it through: what could sound cool one moment is just painful, ridiculous or pointless later. Especially if you’ve got the location wrong. (no offensive words on your face, neck and hands please, be polite and act like a grown up). Lettering allows all the fancies, associated with other elements, various fonts or creative tattoo style.</p><p>#lettertattoo #blacklettertattoo #NameInitialTattoo #lettertattoos #name #alphabet #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #anchortattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #letteringtattoo #liontattoo #skulltattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/names-tattoos/">Juhi Name Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Well, nothing could be nearer to the truth than this statement.The worth of a family is too great to be put into words but tattoos are a good way of expressing love and gratitude. People wear their love and pride for their family on their bodies.</p><p>This is one of the sweetest and most meaningful tattoos out there. I mean how can you not love this? A daughter honoring love for her parents by declaring a permanent piece of art. You can’t go wrong with that. Only a person with a hardened heart wouldn’t appreciate this. This tattoo is not just endearing, it is also symbolic and in a way very reassuring that love can and should be flaunted.</p><p><strong>Maa Paa Tattoo</strong></p><p>Someone rightly said once that God could not be anywhere and that is why he created mothers. Mothers are truly special and one can never do enough to show them just how much they are loved and appreciated. But there are some ways through which one can tell their mom just much she is loved. Nothing speaks better than a permanent tattoo. Tattoos are like preserving and expressing love for as long as you are alive. Mothers and special and so they deserve a special place in your life and what better way than to keep her with you forever on a part of you. It is nothing but a sign of truly unbreakable bond.</p><p>The message of this piece alone is worth the pain, time and yeah money to have this done. What I’m trying to get at is that at its very core. This piece of art is done to express love</p><p>“Love means parents”</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/mom-dad-tattoo/">Maa Paa Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karma is the universal law that applies to each and every one of us. It means simply that everything you do will come back to you. Karma is a natural teaching tool, but knowledge, and the ability to apply that knowledge, is a great help.</p><p>This tattoo is the reminder that Good karma comes from truly good actions. It doesn’t work so well when you do good things, but for completely selfish reasons. And it absolutely does not work when you do things only for the purpose of getting a karmic reward. What you put out there is what you are going to get back. And if you do nothing but negative things in this lifetime, it will follow you to your next one.</p><p><strong>WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND</strong></p><p><strong>Karma Tattoo</strong></p><p>To understand&nbsp;<strong>moksha</strong>, which means &#8216;liberation,&#8217; one must first understand several other important ideas in Hinduism &#8211; particularly,&nbsp;<strong>samsara</strong>. Samsara is a Sanskrit word. That refers to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, to the passing of the soul from one life to another. As the soul transitions between these lives, the next incarnation is informed by the deeds of the previous life. This is the Hindu belief of the concept of&nbsp;<strong>karma</strong>. You may have heard people talk about karma and the idea that people&#8217;s choices will come back to affect them one way or another in the future. The Hindu concept of karma is similar to the popular use, but a person&#8217;s responsibility for her/his actions. good or bad, is dealt with in the next life, not the current one.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/karma-tattoo/">Karma Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">Peacock Feather Tattoo – The peacock is known as the bird with 100 eyes, referring to the pattern on its tail feathers.</a></p><p>These eyes are considered to be all seeing, as well as being the “evil eyes.” The eye on the peacock feather tattoo could mean that you are an open minded person – the one that looks at the world with eyes wide open, the one that is not afraid of challenges. On the other hand, in Egyptian, Roman and Greek mythology, the eye on the peacock feather is considered to be the “evil eye.” This is not always a bad thing – the “evil eye” symbols give the evil eye, as well as, protect the one who wears them.</p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">Peacock Tattoo are generally a very beautiful and gentle feminine tattoo designs.</a></p><p>A lot of girls choose peacock feather simply because it is more beautiful than other feathers, while only a small number associates the feather to the meaning of peacock tattoos.</p><p>Feathers symbolize creativity, spiritual evaluation and rebirth. Most common places for a peacock feather are ribs, scapulas or a side of the lower back. Peacock feather should, by all means, be done in full color – it is the colors that make it so beautiful.</p><p>This is an expression that was first used back in the 14th century, and it is still quite common today. It is also the meaning of a peacock feather tattoo design.</p><p>Peacock feather tattoo could indicate a very proud person. It could be comprehended in two ways – the person wearing it could either be very proud of herself for good reasons, or simply very arrogant. If you don’t want to be perceived as an arrogant person, I’d suggest you choose a smaller tattoo. Rather than one that goes across your whole back.</p><p>The peacock is a very important bird for people in India. It still has a status of a worshiped bird, mainly because it slays snakes. That peacocks are immune to snake bites. Their blood to chase away evil spirits. Peacock feather tattoo can be a symbol of protection against those spirits. Or simply people who would like to hurt you.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/peacock-tattoo/">Peacock Feather Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Amazing Name Tattoo</strong></p><p>Tattoos are associated with drawings, but another trend is leading it toward more literary content. Lettering tattoos are not simple though.</p><p>Sometimes, words and names begin to be as obsessive that you need to keep them forever on your flesh: the first name of a loved one, a word that describes your rules of life, a sentence written by a talented writer/songwriter or something wise you wish could lead your path. Lettering is probably one of the most personal and meaningful type of a tattoo and that&#8217;s why it is very important to get the right design and tattoo artist. First, make sure to choose the best looking fonts: the size, spacing and readability are extremely important. Even if you want something very small, your tattoo has to be clear and readable from a good distance, or when aging it will completely be illegible.</p><p>Then, check the spelling more than twice with your artist and relatives. Don&#8217;t spend the rest of your life with one of those awful mistakes that you can see around the web. And finally, think it through: what could sound cool one moment is just painful, ridiculous or pointless later, especially if you&#8217;ve got the location wrong (no offensive words on your face, neck and hands please, be polite and act like a grown up). That is said, lettering allows all the fancies, associated with other elements, various fonts or creative tattoo style.</p><p>#nametattoo #lettertattoo #blacklettertattoo #NameInitialTattoo #lettertattoos #name #alphabet #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #anchortattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #letteringtattoo #liontattoo #skulltattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/amazing-name-tattoo/">Amazing Name Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
