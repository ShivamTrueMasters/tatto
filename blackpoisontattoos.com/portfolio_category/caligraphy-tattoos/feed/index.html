										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve spent months deciding on the right tattoo, and finally, it&#8217;s time to get inked. You&#8217;re excited and nervous, but one question remains: What is the best place to put your new tattoo? Should it be on your arm or your chest? An ankle or back? The answer is simple: any place you want! Well&#8230; maybe not literally any spot—you probably don&#8217;t want to get a giant portrait of your ex on your forehead. But generally speaking, there are no hard-and-fast rules about where you should get tattooed. That said, there are some considerations that may make certain locations more appealing than others for different people; this article will help guide you through those considerations so that when you choose where to get inked, it&#8217;ll be an experience that makes both you and whoever gets to see it happy!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-persist-tattoo-meaning">Persist Tattoo Meaning</h4><p>The meaning behind the Persist tattoo is to keep going, keep trying and keep fighting. It means that no matter what happens in life it&#8217;s important to stay positive and move forward.</p><p>Persistence is a character trait that some people have but others don&#8217;t. The Persist tattoo means that you&#8217;re a person who will never give up on what they want in their life and will work hard towards getting it.</p><p>If you&#8217;re struggling to make something happen with your life and are wondering how to persist, get this phrase tattooed on yourself!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-has-to-be-something-that-feels-important-to-you-and-your-life">It has to be something that feels important to you and your life.</h4><p>A script tattoo is one that has meaning, and it&#8217;s essential to take the time to find a design that makes sense for you. It has to be something that feels important to you and your life. You don&#8217;t want a tattoo just because it looks cool or other people have them—it&#8217;s got to be something that will make sense with your personality and lifestyle.</p><p>It also has to be something that fits into your long-term plans: &#8220;I&#8217;m going through this phase right now,&#8221; or &#8220;My dad wants me not having tattoos&#8221; are NOT good reasons for getting a script tattoo! If you&#8217;re looking at getting something specific in mind then talk about why this particular phrase/word would best fit what you want in a piece of art on your body forever! Make sure there&#8217;s no regret later down the road!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-script-tattoo">Script Tattoo</h4><p>The Persist Script Tattoo is the perfect script tattoo for those who are fans of the word “persist”. The word itself means to continue doing something even when it seems impossible, and this tattoo represents that perfectly. If you want a tattoo that can help you stay motivated, then this is the one for you!</p><p>Persist Word Tattoo Meaning</p><p>The meaning behind this word makes it even more important than others in our opinion as it reminds people to always keep going no matter what happens in life. This single word has helped many people get through some very difficult times, so we think it’s important to carry on those traditions by passing them along yourself!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-couple-tattoo">Couple Tattoo</h4><p>Couple Tattoo Meaning</p><p>With the help of the internet, you can get a lot of ideas for couple of tattoos. You may have seen some on Instagram, Pinterest, or other social media sites and wondered what their meaning is or how to get one yourself. It&#8217;s important that you ask yourself why you want to get a tattoo with your partner before getting one together. Couple tattoos are very popular and can mean various things depending on who gets them and what they look like. Some people think that they represent love in its purest form while others associate them with marriage; however, there are many more meanings associated with couple tattoos than just these two interpretations!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>Now that you know about the meaning of these tattoos, you can start searching for one that reflects your personality and beliefs. If you want a tattoo for an important value or belief, then we suggest taking the time to learn more about these ideas before deciding on what design will work best for you. With so many beautiful styles available today it doesn&#8217;t have to be difficult to find one that suits your interests.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/persist-script-tattoo/">Persist Script Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Amazing Name Tattoo</strong></p><p>Tattoos are associated with drawings, but another trend is leading it toward more literary content. Lettering tattoos are not simple though.</p><p>Sometimes, words and names begin to be as obsessive that you need to keep them forever on your flesh: the first name of a loved one, a word that describes your rules of life, a sentence written by a talented writer/songwriter or something wise you wish could lead your path. Lettering is probably one of the most personal and meaningful type of a tattoo and that&#8217;s why it is very important to get the right design and tattoo artist. First, make sure to choose the best looking fonts: the size, spacing and readability are extremely important. Even if you want something very small, your tattoo has to be clear and readable from a good distance, or when aging it will completely be illegible.</p><p>Then, check the spelling more than twice with your artist and relatives. Don&#8217;t spend the rest of your life with one of those awful mistakes that you can see around the web. And finally, think it through: what could sound cool one moment is just painful, ridiculous or pointless later, especially if you&#8217;ve got the location wrong (no offensive words on your face, neck and hands please, be polite and act like a grown up). That is said, lettering allows all the fancies, associated with other elements, various fonts or creative tattoo style.</p><p>#nametattoo #lettertattoo #blacklettertattoo #NameInitialTattoo #lettertattoos #name #alphabet #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #anchortattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #letteringtattoo #liontattoo #skulltattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/amazing-name-tattoo/">Amazing Name Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>3D Star Tattoo with Nice Words Inked by Black Poison Tattoos</p><p>Some nice words like friendship, freedom, family, love, and more are inserted into a large 3D star Tattoo.</p><p>Star tattoos can be nice and unique delegate of your inner personality and conviction. Star tattoo designs look cool and they are a good preference for a very first ink piece because a star is typically small in design and doesn’t need to be awfully intricate. These designs look attractive and generally they signify a change in life.</p><p>The star is one of the oldest classical cryptograms and it has been an important image in many cultures and religions. When human knew nothing about them, what actually they are, still they were very lovable by human. In the ancient times, human stared up at the sky and attempted to explain that superlative view with the help of myths and religion.</p><p>They are universal cryptograms, not attached to an exact religion or culture, and actually can mean plenty of unique things to plenty of unique people. Male and females have separate star tattoos designs prearranged for them. Females love the shooting stars since they look very feminine, whereas guys love the nautical stars since they look manly. Star tattoos can be drawn as a single star, solitary star, or as an assemblage of small stars, celestial, or nautical designs.</p><p>Star tattoos designs are very flexible and can mesh up with wings, skulls, moon &amp; sun, scroll, flowers, butterfly, fairy and we think almost every kind of image or symbol can be mesh up with stars with the aim of generating a unique and personal tattoo. If you are looking for unique star tattoos not those common or creepy designs.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/3d-star-tattoo/">3D Star Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
