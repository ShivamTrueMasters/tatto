										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoo art has always been a medium for self-expression, often reflecting an individual&#8217;s personality, beliefs, or experiences through permanent ink designs.</p><p>In the case of a particularly striking tattoo, a unique blend of whimsical humor and dark, intricate imagery creates a fascinating visual statement.</p><p>This tattoo showcases a skeletal figure wearing a jester&#8217;s hat, with two phrases encircling it: &#8220;Why so serious?&#8221; and &#8220;Hakuna Matata.&#8221;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fusion-of-contrasting-themes">The Fusion of Contrasting Themes</h3><p>The tattoo masterfully combines elements that are traditionally seen as opposites.</p><p>On one hand, the iconic phrase &#8220;Why so serious?&#8221; &#8211; popularized by the Joker in &#8220;The Dark Knight&#8221; &#8211; conjures a sense of deep, unsettling introspection about the darker sides of human nature.</p><p>On the other hand, &#8220;Hakuna Matata,&#8221; a Swahili phrase meaning &#8220;no worries,&#8221; brings in lightness and a carefree attitude, famously featured in the cheerful context of Disney&#8217;s &#8220;The Lion King.&#8221;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-artistic-details-and-symbolism">Artistic Details and Symbolism</h3><p>The detailed execution of the skull within the design is not just a representation of mortality or macabre but is stylized with exaggerated features typical of a jester.</p><p>This not only adds a layer of irony but also deepens the narrative by blending the seriousness of existential themes with the light-hearted dismissal of such worries.</p><p>The jester’s hat, embellished with bells, traditionally symbolizes folly and jest, yet here it is worn by a skull, perhaps hinting at the foolishness of ignoring the inevitability of death.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cultural-and-personal-significance">Cultural and Personal Significance</h3><p>This tattoo could be interpreted as a reflection of the wearer’s philosophy of life—balancing the gravity of life&#8217;s inevitable challenges with a spirited, positive outlook.</p><p>It serves as a permanent reminder to not take life too seriously, thus resonating with a broad audience who find themselves oscillating between these two extremes.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>The tattoo not only stands as a piece of personal art but also engages with viewers by presenting a narrative that is open to interpretation.</p><p>Its ability to juxtapose profound depth with whimsical levity makes it a remarkable example of modern tattoo artistry.</p><p>This design not only catches the eye but also stimulates a deeper reflection on the balance of life&#8217;s dark and light moments.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/why-so-serious-hakuna-matata-tattoo/">😯 Why so serious?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos are one of the most personal and creative forms of self-expression. Among the endless design possibilities, blue floral tattoos have a unique allure. Positioned on the back, these designs offer a combination of elegance, symbolism, and aesthetic beauty, making them a top choice for many women. In this post, we’ll explore the artistic significance and reasons why a blue floral tattoo on the back can be a stunning addition to your body art.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-choose-a-floral-tattoo">Why Choose a Floral Tattoo?</h3><p>Floral tattoos are timeless. Flowers symbolize a variety of emotions and concepts—from love and passion to purity and serenity. For centuries, flowers have been used as a form of communication. The art of &#8220;floriography,&#8221; or the language of flowers, dates back to ancient civilizations where each bloom held specific meanings. A tattoo allows you to express these messages permanently in a design that reflects your personal story.</p><p>For women, the back is an ideal canvas for large, detailed designs. With ample space to work with, tattoo artists can create intricate patterns, letting the floral motif flow naturally. The design can stretch across the shoulders or cascade down the spine, blending with the natural curvature of the body for a truly mesmerizing effect.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-symbolism-behind-blue-floral-tattoos">The Symbolism Behind Blue Floral Tattoos</h3><p>The color blue itself holds deep meaning. Blue flowers are often associated with calmness, wisdom, and tranquility. They symbolize peace and the pursuit of the impossible, as blue flowers are rare in nature. A blue floral tattoo brings together these elements of serenity and introspection while adding a unique pop of color against the skin.</p><p>Here are a few flowers often seen in blue floral tattoos and their meanings:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Blue Rose:</strong> Symbolizes mystery, intrigue, and the impossible.</li>

<li><strong>Forget-Me-Not:</strong> Represents true love and remembrance.</li>

<li><strong>Blue Lotus:</strong> Signifies wisdom, knowledge, and spiritual awakening.</li>

<li><strong>Cornflower:</strong> Often associated with hope, loyalty, and devotion.</li></ul><p>Each flower has a different significance, and depending on what speaks to you, your blue floral tattoo can be customized to embody the traits you most value.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-back-is-the-perfect-canvas">Why the Back is the Perfect Canvas</h3><p>The back offers a broad, flat area for a tattoo artist to showcase their skills. Unlike other parts of the body, it allows for larger and more detailed designs. A tattoo on the back can remain hidden under clothing, offering the flexibility to reveal or conceal it as desired. For women, the back provides a more intimate placement that still allows for bold artistic expression.</p><p>Another appeal of back tattoos is that they age well. Since the back is less exposed to sunlight compared to other areas like the arms or legs, it’s less prone to fading, ensuring that your blue floral tattoo will remain vibrant for years to come.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-designing-your-blue-floral-tattoo">Designing Your Blue Floral Tattoo</h3><p>When it comes to designing a blue floral tattoo, there’s no shortage of inspiration. Many women choose to incorporate vines or other natural elements that complement the floral design. Vines can be used to connect multiple flowers, creating a flowing, organic look that follows the natural lines of the back.</p><p>Additionally, some choose to include other symbols that hold personal meaning. Butterflies, birds, or even celestial elements like stars and moons can add depth and personalization to the design. Collaborating with a skilled tattoo artist ensures that your design not only looks beautiful but also resonates with your individual story.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-tattoo-process-what-to-expect">The Tattoo Process: What to Expect</h3><p>Getting a tattoo on your back is a bit more involved than on other parts of your body. Depending on the size and complexity of the design, it may take multiple sessions to complete. Before starting, your artist will usually create a stencil of your design, giving you a chance to approve the placement and look.</p><p>It’s important to choose a reputable tattoo artist, especially for a design as detailed as a floral back tattoo. Look for someone with experience in fine line work and color shading to ensure the blue hues come out vibrant and even.</p><p>During the healing process, you’ll need to follow the aftercare instructions carefully. Since your back might rub against clothing, it&#8217;s crucial to keep the area clean and moisturized to prevent irritation and promote proper healing.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3><p>A blue floral tattoo on the back is more than just body art—it’s a statement. Whether you’re drawn to the symbolism of blue flowers or the aesthetic appeal of a detailed, flowing design, this type of tattoo offers a unique blend of beauty and meaning. For women looking to make a bold yet elegant choice, a blue floral tattoo on the back is a design that will stand the test of time.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/blue-floral-tattoo-on-back-of-a-girl/">Blue Floral Tattoo on Back of a Girl: A Timeless Design Choice</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Today, we&#8217;re focusing on a specific design: wings emblazoned with initials.</p><p><strong>What could it symbolize?</strong></p><p>The combination of wings and initials offers a rich tapestry of interpretations. Here are a few possibilities:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Guardianship:</strong>&nbsp;Wings are often associated with angels, protectors, and spiritual guides.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Rose tattoos will never get old. </strong></p><p>They stand for a timeless <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">beauty</a> that never fades and, if done right, never fails to delight. Rose Tattoo</p><p>There are many myths and legends surrounding the creation of the rose. Its beauty, its fragrance, even the thorns have stories that explain the conception of this glorious flower. These rose tattoos are awesome embodiments of humans&#8217; constant attraction to a flower that has had everyone smitten since the dawn of time.</p><p>It was a symbol of love and beauty associated with the goddess, but also came to stand for secrecy after Cupid offered a rose to the God of Silence to keep quiet Venus’s affairs. In fact, Roman dining room ceilings were decorated with roses to urge guests to keep quiet about what was said at dinner, and “sub rosa” or “under the rose” still means “confidentially” today.&#8221;</p><p>The traditional red rose tattoo symbolizes love and passion. A pink rose represents grace, gratitude, and affection while purple roses have been used to symbolize royalty and enchantment.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><p>Thus, for instance, in Greece this flower symbolized the blood of Aphrodite, in Rome it has been connected with the goddess Diana, who has transformed her lover into a rose, in Egypt it was a favorite flower of Isis, in Christian countries the rose has been associated with the blood of Christ. In the East, this flower was the sign of pure and sincere love.</p><p>In the current world, the denotation of the rose depends on its color and it doesn’t matter where the tattoo will be placed.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A black rose denotes tragic love, various subcultures invest their own meaning. Hence, for example, goths reckon that the black rose is death, for anarchists the same symbol is the fight.</li><li>A white rose shows pure love and a faithful essence of its owner.</li><li>A red rose indicates passion, desire, and love, whereas a burgundy rose spells out the idea of inner harmony.</li><li>A blue rose represents a sophisticated nature of a human, who wears it. He or she renounces all rules and foundations, adopted in the society, besides, this person strives for something unattainable.</li><li>A yellow rose has altered its meaning: at first, it meant jealousy, but now it connotes dedication.</li><li>An orange rose conveys that the owner is enthusiastic and attractive.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/rose-tattoo-3/">Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Remember that harming none includes harming yourself! &nbsp;This tattoo is the reminder that Good karma comes from truly good actions. It doesn’t work so well when you do good things, but for completely selfish reasons. And it absolutely does not work when you do things only for the purpose of getting a karmic reward.</p><p>Karma is in general formed by the combination of a person&#8217;s actions and intents. It depends not only on what the person actually does but also by the nature of their inner self.</p><p>The traditional, philosophical uses of karma have helped to connect the word. With a sense of &#8220;cosmic justice&#8221; in the Western vocabulary. In this sense, karma is often to refer to a mystic. The indefinable force that influences one&#8217;s immediate future. Western usage includes two distinct types of karma. There&#8217;s &#8220;good karma,&#8221; which one generates by doing good deeds and treating others well, and &#8220;bad karma,&#8221; which one creates by being inconsiderate and treating others poorly.</p><p><strong>Having a net amount of &#8220;good karma&#8221; will lead to good fortune in the future.

According to the doctrine, good conduct brings a pleasant and happy result and creates a tendency toward similar good acts. While bad conduct brings an evil result and creates a tendency toward similar evil acts.,</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/karma-tattoo-2/">Karma Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us have owned or seen diamonds at some point. When we think about them, we often think about wealth, luxury and fashion, even the higher quality of one&#8217;s life. Some people wear diamonds on their ring fingers while others wear them on their skin, having a micro dermally implanted diamond. Diamonds have decorated all types of ancient and royal crowns and are called a &#8220;<i>girl&#8217;s best friend.</i>&#8220;</p><p><b>History:</b>&nbsp;The word &#8220;diamond&#8221; is Greek in origin (<span class="s1">ἀ</span>δάμας–<i>adámas</i>&nbsp;or &#8220;unbreakable&#8221;) and means strength and invincibility. They are made of a nearly indestructible mineral, created deep in the earth by massive pressure weighing down on carbon deposits and then brought up to the earth&#8217;s surface via volcanic eruptions. One of the earliest recorded accounts of diamonds was from India around 400 BC. Today, most come from Africa.</p><p><b>Beauty:</b>&nbsp;You&#8217;ll find diamonds in fashion magazines and on any red carpet or runway. There are sayings that equate these gems with inner beauty (like a &#8220;diamond in the rough&#8221;). which is apt, since they appear rough on the outside when first mined, but once they are polished, their beauty is revealed. To the tattoo wearer, the diamond may represent inner beauty, as in the saying, &#8220;true beauty is found on the inside.&#8221;</p><p><b>Power:</b>&nbsp;We often associate diamonds with wealth and the power that money can bring. The gem is very expensive and multiple diamonds may represent great wealth and value. They are extremely coveted items and some people will do anything to get their hands on them.</p><p><b>Words about Diamonds:</b>&nbsp;As I stated earlier, some tattoos incorporate famous quotes or personal words to underline and accentuate the meaning of the tattoo. These quotes may be placed on ribbons or&nbsp;<span class="s2">banners</span>&nbsp;or inked inside or outside the diamond design. Another popular thing that people do is have the first letter of their own name. The name of a loved one inked inside the diamond.</p><p><b>Diamond as a Birthstone:</b>&nbsp;People born in April claim the diamond as their birthstone. A tattoo may be used to represent the month a person was born. Since diamonds are associated with the month of April. The gem might be used as a symbolic representation of anything or anyone that began that month.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/diamond-wings-tattoo/">Diamond Wings Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The unalome symbol represents the path to enlightenment in the Buddhist culture. The spirals symbolizes the twists and turns in life, and the straight lines the moment one reaches enlightenment or peace and harmony. The dots at the end of the symbol represent death, or the moment we fade to nothing. There are multiple designs for unalome tattoos, or you can create your own and add your own elements, such as the lotus flower to represent new beginnings.</p><p>The&nbsp;<b>Unalome</b>&nbsp;is originally a Hindu symbol that graphically recalls Shiva´s third eye and it represents wisdom and the path to perfection. …</p><p>The Unalome Lotus Tattoo symbolizes overcoming adversities towards perfection.</p><p>Thus perfectly integrating the&nbsp;<b>meaning</b>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<b>Unalome</b>.</p><p><strong>Lotus Flower Meaning in Buddhism</strong></p><p>In Buddhism, the lotus is associated with purity, spiritual awakening and faithfulness. The flower is considered pure as it is able to emerge from murky waters in the morning and be perfectly clean.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Buddhism Culture</strong>&nbsp;– According to Buddhist religion, lotus defines purity and piousness of the soul, as the flower grows in a muddy area, yet maintains its purity. The belief is based on the fact that you will find a perfectly complete miniatures lotus plant within a seed, which implies that even a human being is born complete and yearns for perfection through his journey of life. Also, Buddhism has meanings for various colors of lotus flowers, as a red colored lotus stands for the heart, which implies love and passion. Similarly, a pink lotus represents devotion towards the divine, while a blue one stands for learning and intelligence. A white colored lotus implies purity and peace, both at spiritual as well as intellectual level.</li><li><strong>Chinese Culture</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese culture sees lotus as a flower with perfect beauty stands as a source of inspiration for poets and artists since times immemorial.</li><li><strong>Western Culture</strong>&nbsp;– The Western culture has a similar kind of reflection of this charming flower. Because it denotes new beginning and rebirth as it is reflects divine conception. It also links lotus flower with the search of true meaning of life.</li></ul><p><span id="Lotus_Flower_Tattoo_Placement_and_Designs"><strong>Unalome Lotus Tattoo</strong></span></p><p>Besides a wide number of options regarding the preferred placement of lotus flower tattoos. There is an equally wide variety in the designs available too.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Lotus Flower in Water</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;–&nbsp;Another popular lotus tattoo design is the one which shows the pure and beautiful flower. Standing in the backdrop of a pool of water, which adds a new meaning to the tattoo.</li><li><strong>Matching Lotus Flower Tattoos&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong>As we have seen before, Chinese culture associates this flower with harmony and mutual trust. Which is why many people wear matching lotus tattoos to strengthen their relationships. On the other hand, the Japanese style tattoo design includes lotus flower along with clouds.</li><li><strong>Lotus Flower Tattoo with Dragon</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Some Japanese tattoo designers have also teamed up these stunning looking flowers. With the traditional dragon pattern for excellent end results.</li><li><strong>Tribal Lotus Flower Tattoo design</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;The tribal designs in lotus tattoo are entirely in black color. Though contemporary designs can combine some other colors with it. The traditional sleeve tattoo in lotus design covers the entire arm of the bearer. Which is quite a popular choice among tattoo lovers.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/unalome-lotus-tattoo/">Unalome Lotus Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-text-align-left">The&nbsp;Symbol of Chaos&nbsp;originates from Michael Moorcock&#8217;s Eternal Champion stories. &#8230; In contrast, the&nbsp;symbol&nbsp;of Law is a single upright arrow. It is also called the Arms of&nbsp;Chaos, the Arrows of&nbsp;Chaos, the&nbsp;Chaos&nbsp;Star, the&nbsp;Chaos&nbsp;Cross, the Chaosphere, or the&nbsp;Symbol&nbsp;of Eight.While the peace sign is a highly recognizable symbol, there are many ways that people who wear it can add variety to it and make it a more personal image. People with friends or family in the military will add a yellow ribbon or dog tags to signify their military connection.</p><p class="has-text-align-left">A peace sign can also represent that a person who is going through a rocky transformation or a tumultuous time is keeping their mind focused on the goal. Drawing around the peace sign or within the peace sign also turns the symbol into something more meaningful. Often people will request the flag of a country or a dove to make the picture more meaningful.</p><p><strong>Peace symbol tattoos can actually be a request for two different types of designs.</strong></p><p>This request ether means the circle with the vertical line splitting into three forks or the human hand holding up the index and the middle finger with the thumb overlaid across the ring and pinky fingers; not with the back side of the hand showing. This has a completely different meaning in different &nbsp;parts of the world.</p><p>Inner peace tattoos are calming and relaxing and have several meanings. General inner peace represents a state of spiritual and mental peace.</p><p>There is no single design or rule to live with here. Some symbols that you can use to represent peace include Yin Yang, Buddha, lotus, peace and flowers.</p><p>Tribal peace sign tattoos are among the most popular peace sign designs. The tattoos are inked in many variations mostly portrayed alone or inked with other elements and symbols. Men mostly wear the tattoos even though there are women who sport them.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/chaos-tattoo/">Chaos Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

While popular, dreamcatchers do not feature in all Native American cultures.

Obviously, this huge swath of different cultures and locations barely narrows it down, so determining exactly where they originated proves impossible.</p><p>In the 60s and 70s, the Pan-Indian movement sought to unify many different American Indian tribes across the nations to better coordinate their protest of some shady government claims. While many tribes already formed a coalition of nations—even before the Europeans landed on the continent—this surge represented the largest movement to fight back for their land.</p><p>During the Pan-Indian movement, many different tribes shared the unique quirks of their particular tribes and bands. During this time, the dreamcatcher became a popular symbol for many different tribes across a huge swath of North America. People easily recognized it, and it looked awesome. To this day, dreamcatchers appear in traditional shops far away from their original location.</p><p>During this time, the dreamcatcher became a popular symbol for many different tribes across a huge swath of North America.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mermaid is a creature of the sea. It lives amongst marine flora and fauna. That is why a shoal of fish surrounding a mermaid would make an appropriate mermaid tattoo.Wearing a mermaid tattoo is not just beautiful but carries some element of mystery that may not be easily understood and a perfect description for part of human nature.There are numerous meanings associated with mermaid tattoos As it said to symbolize, sensuality, temptation, intuition, danger and a sign of femininity.This is piece of “tattoo” which is a beautiful emotion and &nbsp;which is beyond any wordsbecause it itself express everything.&nbsp;</p><p>A&nbsp;<strong>mermaid&nbsp;</strong>love for her&nbsp;<strong>child&nbsp;</strong>is so sacred, it is quite hard to put into words.</p><p>&nbsp;There is nothing more powerful than a&nbsp;mother and son bond. She will always be the first woman in his life and he will grow to be her best man forever and always. From the first moment she holds him in her arms, everything changes for both of them.Do you remember the old phrase ” Mama’s Boy! ” well it exists for a reason, the relationship between a son and his mom will always be unique and sometimes weird, but it is what it is. Like girls are always more close to their dads, so the boys are always little mama’s boy. If you’re a boy and you happen to be reading this right now, you know it to be true.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mermaid Tattoo</strong></p><p>No words can describe the beauty of a mother-son relationship and its enigma. Across the world, this is frequently illustrated by tattoo artists with various color combinations. Sometimes, new mothers prefer sporting tattoos with their son’s name mentioning their birthdays on wrists, neck, and backs.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/mermaid-tattoo/">Mermaid Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Until the very end&#8221; is a quote from Deathly Hallows. Harry&#8217;s walking to his death and uses the Resurrection Stone to bring back the people who meant the most to him. When he asks if they&#8217;ll stay with him, James replies, &#8220;Until the very end.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Harry Potter Tattoos</strong></p><p>The Deathly Hallows symbol is a simple representation of the Deathly Hallows artifacts: the Elder Wand, the resurrection stone and the invisibility cloak. The symbol consists of triangle, with a circle inside it. A straight line bisects the circle and the top of the triangle.</p><p><strong>The triangle represents the cloak; the circle represents the resurrection stone; and the straight line represents the Elder Wand.</strong></p><p>. The brothers are skilled wizards who unite their powers to cross a river, where Death usually claims victims. Death schemes to trick them by offering each a gift. The eldest brother asks for an unbeatable wand, the second brother asks for the power to raise the dead, and the final brother asks for an invisibility cloak. Death claims the first two brothers, but the youngest brother lives until he is ready to take off the cloak and reveal himself to Death.</p><p>The Hallows united would supposedly make the person who owns them the master of Death itself. The myth, as Hermione reads it in&nbsp;<i>Beedle the Bard</i>, has a basis in fact. The three Peverell brothers, according to Dumbledore, were exceedingly talented magicians who created the objects themselves.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/harry-potter-tattoos/">Until The Very End Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos are associated with drawings, but another trend is leading it toward more literary content. Lettering tattoos are not simple though.</p><p>Sometimes, words and names begin to be as obsessive that you need to keep them forever on your flesh: the first name of a loved one, a word that describes your rules of life, a sentence written by a talented writer/songwriter or something wise you wish could lead your path. Lettering is probably one of the most personal and meaningful type of a tattoo and that’s why it is very important to get the right design and tattoo artist. First, make sure to choose the best looking fonts: the size, spacing and readability are extremely important. Even if you want something very small, your tattoo has to be clear and readable from a good distance. When aging it will completely be illegible.</p><p>Then, check the spelling more than twice with your artist and relatives. Don’t spend the rest of your life with one of those awful mistakes that you can see around the web. And finally, think it through: what could sound cool one moment is just painful, ridiculous or pointless later. Especially if you’ve got the location wrong. (no offensive words on your face, neck and hands please, be polite and act like a grown up). Lettering allows all the fancies, associated with other elements, various fonts or creative tattoo style.</p><p>#lettertattoo #blacklettertattoo #NameInitialTattoo #lettertattoos #name #alphabet #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #anchortattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #letteringtattoo #liontattoo #skulltattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/names-tattoos/">Juhi Name Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has their own personal meanings attached to their tattoos and this one is customised and free hand tattoo which was personal yet close&nbsp; for my client</p><p>Someone has said that the love of a family is life’s greatest blessing. Well, nothing could be nearer to the truth than this statement.The worth of a family is too great to be put into words but tattoos are a good way of expressing love and gratitude. People wear their love and pride for their family on their bodies.</p><p>This is one of the sweetest and most meaningful tattoos out there. I mean how can you not love this? A daughter honoring love for her parents by declaring a permanent piece of art. You can’t go wrong with that. Only a person with a hardened heart wouldn’t appreciate this. This tattoo is not just endearing, it is also symbolic and in a way very reassuring that love can and should be flaunted.</p><p><strong>Maa Paa Tattoo</strong></p><p>Someone rightly said once that God could not be anywhere and that is why he created mothers. Mothers are truly special and one can never do enough to show them just how much they are loved and appreciated. But there are some ways through which one can tell their mom just much she is loved. Nothing speaks better than a permanent tattoo. Tattoos are like preserving and expressing love for as long as you are alive. Mothers and special and so they deserve a special place in your life and what better way than to keep her with you forever on a part of you. It is nothing but a sign of truly unbreakable bond.</p><p>The message of this piece alone is worth the pain, time and yeah money to have this done. What I’m trying to get at is that at its very core. This piece of art is done to express love</p><p>“Love means parents”</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/mom-dad-tattoo/">Maa Paa Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

A Tiger Eye Tattoo symbolizes your most primitive desires; you are moving and thinking simply on instinct and drive. The eye of the tiger represents the animal in its purest state; it is stalking, hungry, focused, and, most importantly, lethal.</p><p><strong>Tiger Eye Tattoo Designs</strong></p><p>When it comes to animal tattoos, the tiger ranks up there with the best of them. Tigers have been a part of fashion, magic acts, and carnivals for years. Their beautiful stripes make them very attractive in fashion, art, and tattoos. Although the lion is considered to be the king of the jungle, it is actually the tiger. The largest percentage of tigers live in the dense jungles of Asia. Due to the popularity of their fur coats, they&#8217;re on the endangered species list. The beauty and symbolism of the tiger has made it a highly sought-after tattoo.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The Bengal and Siberian tigers are absolutely beautiful animals. The Bengal is orange with black stripes, while the Siberian is white with black stripes.</li><li>They are deadly jungle predators. The humans who still live in the jungles where these tigers roam have to be on constant alert for them. One of the tiger&#8217;s strengths is his ability to hunt and ambush his prey without detection.</li><li>The tiger has played a very important role in Asian cultures, such as China and Japan. In these cultures, the tiger ranks right up there with the dragon. You may also see tiger tattoos that actually have a dragon.</li><li>Japanese Samurai had tigers on their crests.</li><li>As you have already read, the tiger is an endangered animal. Due to this fact, the tiger tattoo has become very important for those who care about the tiger species and conservation. These people wear the tiger tattoo with pride as a reminder of their work.</li><li>As of today, there are only a few thousand left in the entire world. The species became endangered after people had been hunting them for their fur.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/tiger-eye-tattoo-designs/">Tiger Eye Tattoo Designs</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="s1">Watercolour lotus tattoo designs are widely preferred by tattoo lovers all around the world. Popular amongst both, men and women, lotus design is not only revered for its beauty, but also reflects a deeper spiritual meaning. The flower grows in muddy water, yet symbolises purity and harmony. As a tattoo design too, lotus stands for the same attributes in human nature and depicts the thoughts and attitude of the bearer. </span><span class="s1">Aside from the Victorian and contemporary meanings for the Lotus, there is a wealth of symbolism tying these flowers to Hinduism, Buddhism, and the ancient Egyptian’s religious practices.</span></p><p><strong>Watercolor Lotus Tattoo Design</strong></p><p><span class="s1">The ancient Egyptians used the plant extensively as a symbol in the paintings. And carvings left on the walls of temples and tombs. Scholars believe the Egyptians viewed the Lotus as a symbol of rebirth. Because it appeared to sink at night and rise again in the morning. It is the plant simply loses old blooms and adds new ones on a daily cycle, but it is still a potent reminder of reincarnation and the mysteries of the afterlife. The priests and other religious leaders also brewed the flowers to make a tea with sedative and mild psychotropic effects, which heightened their sense for ritual work.</span></p><p><span class="s1"><b>Buddhism Culture</b> – According to Buddhist religion, lotus defines purity and piousness of the soul,Patience,Mysticism,Direct Spiritual Contact,Emptiness from Desire,Victory over Attachments,Enlightenment and the Bodhi State,Love and Compassion for All Things,Self-Awareness,Faithfulness During Spiritual Development,Rising Out of Suffering&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">as the flower grows in a muddy area, yet maintains its purity. The belief is based on the fact that you will find a perfectly complete miniatures lotus plant within a seed. Which implies that even a human being is born complete and yearns for perfection through his journey of life. </span></p><p><span class="s1"><strong>Also, Buddhism has meanings for various colors of lotus flowers, as a red colored. Lotus stands for the heart, which implies love and passion. </strong></span></p><p><span class="s1">Similarly, a pink lotus represents devotion towards the divine, while a blue one stands for learning and intelligence. A white colored lotus implies purity and peace, both at spiritual as well as intellectual level. The Buddhist mythology says that the Buddha was born from this pure flower and had a white heart. Which represented his pious soul. Just as a lotus sheds its flowers and seeds together. It signifies a noble soul which guides the other souls on the Earth along the path of Nirvana.</span></p><p><span class="s1"><b>Egyptian Culture </b>–<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The ancient Egyptian cultures sees lotus as a symbol of the beginning of life and reincarnation, as the mythology of this culture narrates that origination of life on earth was marked by the blooming of this mystical flower from the sea.</span></p><p><span class="s1"><b>Chinese Culture</b> –<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The Chinese culture sees lotus as a flower with perfect beauty stands as a source of inspiration for poets and artists. Since times immemorial.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class="s1"><b>Western Culture</b> – The Western culture has a similar kind of reflection of this charming flower. Because it denotes new beginning and rebirth as it reflects divine conception. It also links lotus flower with the search of true meaning of life.</span></p><p><span class="s1">The Lotus meaning in Hinduism is a little different.Brahma, the ultimate creator, emerges from a Lotus as well. This sense of purity arises from the flower’s growing. The habit of rooting in mud and pushing up through the water to bloom.</span></p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/watercolor-lotus-tattoo/">Watercolor Lotus Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

Here, you have a great deal of choice such as natural objects like flowers, animals, insects and celestial bodies, tribal designs, quotation and some futuristic and realistic designs.<br>Mandala tattoos fall into the category of spiritual tattoos as they have deeper spiritual meaning, which make them very different from the rest of the designs as mentioned above. Mandala tattoos largely resemble floral tattoo designs but differ a lot when it comes to the meaning aspect of the tattoos.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoos are associated with drawings, but another trend is leading it toward more literary content. Lettering tattoos are not simple though.</p><p>Sometimes, words and names begin to be as obsessive that you need to keep them forever on your flesh: the first name of a loved one, a word that describes your rules of life, a sentence written by a talented writer/songwriter or something wise you wish could lead your path. Lettering is probably one of the most personal and meaningful type of a tattoo and that&#8217;s why it is very important to get the right design and tattoo artist. First, make sure to choose the best looking fonts: the size, spacing and readability are extremely important. Even if you want something very small, your tattoo has to be clear and readable from a good distance, or when aging it will completely be illegible.</p><p>Then, check the spelling more than twice with your artist and relatives. Don&#8217;t spend the rest of your life with one of those awful mistakes that you can see around the web. And finally, think it through: what could sound cool one moment is just painful, ridiculous or pointless later, especially if you&#8217;ve got the location wrong (no offensive words on your face, neck and hands please, be polite and act like a grown up). That is said, lettering allows all the fancies, associated with other elements, various fonts or creative tattoo style.</p><p>#lettertattoo #blacklettertattoo #NameInitialTattoo #lettertattoos #name #alphabet #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #anchortattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #letteringtattoo #liontattoo #skulltattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/initial-letter-tattoo-2/">Initial Letter Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tattoo of Flying Birds from Tree</p><p>Bird tattoos have been the most famous tattoos for more than hundred years, be it real or imaginary.</p><p>When you look at a flock of birds flying around it leaves you with a good feeling. They look as if they are up in the sky with a particular purpose and are flying around trying to fulfill that. It is a good theme that can be used as a tattoo design in many interesting ways. Here are some great ideas that look good and carry all the symbolism attached to bird tattoos.</p><p>Bird tattoos across the body: You can have a bird placed here and there, just like the flock of birds in the sky. Some see it as quirky but it is an interesting motif to work around</p><p>Bird flock taking off on the base of the throat: Often as children we would draw birds in the process of flying away and this can simply be emulated on the chest area at the base of the throat. The visual can be made more realistic by making the birds smaller as they seem to fly away in the sky</p><p>A flock of birds on the arm: You can have the birds flying in a formulation that is tight or loose in the tattoo depending on how you want it to look. This makes an excellent tattoo choice on the arm as it will make the birds seem more mobile with the movement of your arm</p><p>Flock of Birds on the feet: I wish my feet had wings, is something that we can think of. Getting birds flying away tattooed on the feet, is one of the ways to get that feel at least in the form of imagery</p><p>Birds dragging a man along: It is almost like the birds are pulling up the man so that he can take off on a flight of fancy along with them. It is a quirky and funny way of looking at things.</p><p>Feather to flock of birds: Birds give out feathers, but have you heard of feathers giving out birds. This tattoo design does just that; it shows the feather slowly letting out a flock of birds. A creative take on the theme of flock of birds:</p><p>Dandelion seeds giving out flock of birds: It looks as if the dandelion seeds are becoming birds and this forms an imaginative and interesting picture. With a kind of 3 dimensional effects this can make an interesting tattoo design.</p><p>Flock of birds leaving the cage: This one has a feeling of birds escaping the confines of the cage to the freedom of the sky. The birdcage can be made to look ornamental or old fashioned while the birds flying away can be given a really joyful aspect.</p><p>Chest flock of birds: This looks great with a stunning visual aspect as the birds which have really flown a greater distance seeming to be like just a speck and the other birds which are still close by done in better detail.</p><p>This is an unusual theme that lends itself to the imagination of the artist and the person who is getting it done. Humans have always been fascinated by the ability of birds to fly and this has often been equated with freedom. That too a freedom that knows no borders and has no restriction. A flock of birds in the sky can be something that you can watch captivated for a long time. They fly in different formations often changing them midair, leaving us wondering about why they do that. Plus different birds have different ways of flying. Some have a lazy and casual way about them, while some birds have a purposeful air that makes them look as if they mean serious business.</p><p>#BirdsTattoo #Birds #TreeTattoo #BlackTattoo #Tattoo #Tattoos #Wind #Trees #VIda #Vento #GirlswithTattoos #TattooedGirls #Tattooed #Passaros #Life #Inked #BlackandGrey #QuoteTattoo #Quote #FontTattoo #TattooWoman #girlswithtattoos #tattooartist #tattooart #tattooedgirls #instatattoo #tattoolife #tattoodesign #traditionaltattoo #tattooflash #tattooist #tattoogirl #handtattoo #tattooedgirl #tattooing #tattooshop #blacktattoo #chesttattoo #tattoosofinstagram #rosetattoo #blackandgreytattoo #tattoomodel #tattooer #colortattoo</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/tattoo-of-flying-birds-from-tree-with-quotes/">Flying Birds From Tree</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra Tattoo with Ohm</strong></p><p>Crescent: Shiva bears on his head the crescent of the Panchami (fifth day) moon. This is placed near the fiery third eye and this shows the power of Soma, the sacrificial offering, which is the representative of the moon. It means that Shiva possesses the power of procreation along with the power of destruction. The moon is also a measure of time, thus Crescent also represents his control over time.</p><p>The Cobra Necklace: This suggests that Shiva is beyond the powers of death and is often the sole support in case of distress. He swallowed the poison kalketu for the wellbeing of the Universe. The deadly cobra represents the death aspect that Shiva has thoroughly conquered. The cobras around his neck also represent the dormant energy, called Kundalini, the serpent power. The snake curled three times around the neck of Lord Shiva depicts the past, present, and future times. The snake looking in the right direction of Lord Shiva signifies that the Lord′s perpetual laws of reason and justice preserve natural order in the universe.</p><p>The Vibhuti: Vibhuti is a three-line of ashes drawn on the forehead that signifies the Immortality of the soul and manifested glory of the Lord.</p><p>Tiger Skin: Lord Shiva is shown sitting on or wearing a tiger skin. The tiger is the vehicle of Shakti, the Goddess of power and force. Shiva is beyond and above any kind of force. He is the master of Shakti. The tiger skin that he wears symbolizes victory over every force. Tigers also represent lust. Thus sitting on Tiger skin, Shiva indicates that he has conquered lust.</p><p>The Elephant &amp; Deer Skin: Shiva also wears elephant skins. Elephants represent pride. Wearing elephant skin, Shiva indicates that he has conquered pride. Similarly, deer represent the flickering mind. Shiva wears deer skin which indicates that he has controlled the mind perfectly.</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong>&nbsp;#LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/maha-mrityunjaya-mantra-tattoo-with-om-on-back/">Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra Tattoo with Om on Back</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
