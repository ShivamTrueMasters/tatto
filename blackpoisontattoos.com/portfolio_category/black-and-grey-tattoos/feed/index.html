										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The intricacy and abstract nature of Polynesian armband tattoo arm Band Tattoos have led to their continued popularity for hundreds of years. So They are some of the most varied and eye-catching designs available anywhere in the world, and they have such a wide spectrum of meanings that just about anyone can find a tribal armband tattoo that fits their life.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiki">Tiki</h4><p>Band Tattoo -Tiki is a human-like figure representing Polynesian semi-gods, meaning deified ancestors and heads, who are sublimed after their death. According to their guardian role, they mainly symbolize protection. If you love playing PC games, you’ll find that Tiki patterns are often carved on pillars or stone gates in many lost temples.</p><p>Tiki plays a vital role in Polynesian culture. For example, nose symbols mean sniffing danger before it comes. Tiki’s eyes, nose, mouth, and side faces are all important design elements and most Polynesian tattoo designs contain one or more tiki symbols.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sea-shell">Sea Shell</h4><p>In Polynesian tattoo designs, shells are very common in many designs, especially turtle shells. The turtle shell is a symbol of the turtle, which is a very important sea creature in all the cultures of the Polynesian triangle. It has more meanings than other symbols. Some complex turtle designs could have quite a lot of meanings, according to the elements embedded in them. Turtle shells symbolize longevity, wellness, fertility, and peace</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shark-teeth">Shark Teeth</h4><p>Shark teeth are another fish symbol which is very popular among Polynesian tattoo fans. Nearly over 50% of Polynesian tattoo designs have shark teeth symbols embedded in them.</p><p>Shark teeth usually represent shelter or coverage, guidance, power, ferocity, adaptability, etc. In Polynesian legend, sharks also represent the god of Polynesian people.</p><p><strong>Band Tattoo It has lots of variations and combinations like the ones shown in the pictures above.</strong></p><p>OceanOcean symbols are very common among Polynesian tattoo designs.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here we have a great example of a crossed fingers tattoo. The artist has created the design to look like it&#8217;s been drawn on with a pencil, and this creates an interesting effect. The tattoo features a variety of different colors, including black and grey.</p><p>Crossed fingers tattoos are often associated with good luck. This is because the gesture of crossing your fingers can be interpreted as an expression of hope or optimism. It also reflects the desire for something to happen, or for someone to be successful, which fits in well with the idea behind all good luck charms and superstitions.</p><p>Although this is not always the case, crossed fingers tattoos are often used as good luck charms by those who have suffered from bad luck in their lives &#8211; such as gamblers who have lost money at casinos or poker players who have lost money on games at home or during tournaments. They may believe that if they get a cross between their index finger and thumb (or any other finger) then it will bring them more fortune in future games.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/crossed-fingers-tattoo-design/">Crossed Fingers Tattoo Design</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">The significance<b> of Crescent Moon on Lord Shiva’s Head</b></a></p><p>Shiva Tattva is where there is no mind and the moon signifies the mind. When there is no mind then how can this ‘no-mindedness’ be expressed and how can anybody understand it? You need a little bit of the mind to understand, experience and to express.</p><p>The no-mind, infinite consciousness requires that little bit of mind to express itself in the manifest world. So, to express that inexpressible, that little mind (crescent moon) is on the head.<br>Wisdom is beyond the mind, but it needs to be expressed with a tinge of mind and this is symbolized by the crescent moon.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Damru</strong></b></p><p><b>Damru</b>&nbsp;symbolizes the Universe which is always expanding and collapsing. From an expansion it collapses and then it re-expands, this is the process of creation.<br>If you see your heartbeat, it is not just one straight line but it is a rhythm that goes up and down. The whole world is nothing but rhythms; energy rising and collapsing to rise again. So the&nbsp;damru&nbsp;signifies that. Look at the shape of the&nbsp;damru, from expansion it collapses and again expands.</p><p>Lord shiva tattoo &#8211; The darmru is also a symbol of sound. Sound is rhythm and sound is energy. The whole universe is nothing but a wave function, it is nothing but rhythms. What does quantum physics say? It says the same thing – the whole universe is nothing but rhythms. It is just one wave (Adviata). So the damru signifies the non-dual nature of the universe.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Serpent around Lord Shiva’s Neck</strong></b></p><p>A state of samadhi where there is nothing, just the inner sky of consciousness, is Shiva; where there is alertness and no action. To describe this alertness they put a snake around Shiva’s neck. So the&nbsp;<b>serpent</b>&nbsp;is a symbol of&nbsp;<b>alertness</b>.</p><p>In the state of meditation when the eyes are closed, it gives the impression that the person is sleeping, but he is not asleep, he is alert. To express this state of consciousness, a&nbsp;<b>snake</b>&nbsp;is shown around Lord Shiva’s neck.</p><p><b><strong>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Trishul (Trident)-Lord shiva tattoo</strong></b></p><p><b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;represents the three aspects of consciousness – waking, dreaming and sleeping, and it represents the three&nbsp;gunas – satva, rajas&nbsp;and&nbsp;tamas. Holding a&nbsp;trishul&nbsp;(Trident) signifies that Shiva (the divinity) is above all the three states – waking, dreaming and sleeping, yet is the upholder of these three states.<br>The divinity is beyond the three gunas, but it holds the three&nbsp;gunas&nbsp;together.</p><p><b>Shul</b>&nbsp;means problems or suffering.&nbsp;<b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;means that which destroys all kind of suffering.<br>Three types of pain that arise in life:<br>1.&nbsp;Aadibhautik&nbsp;(physical)<br>2.&nbsp;Aadhyaatmik&nbsp;(spiritual) and<br>3.&nbsp;Aadidaivik&nbsp;(ethereal)<br>What relieves you from all the problems and suffering is the&nbsp;trishul. And it is in the hand of Shiva.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/shiva-shakti-tattoo/">Shiva Shakti Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

We have it to commemorate a member of the family, a relative, a friend or a person you admire who passed away. We have it to mark and raise ourselves up in hard periods in our life. Sometimes, we have it to just praying for the happiness and the health of our family. In general, the religious belief and comfort are what people aim in life.</p><p>God gave a gift to the world when you were born&#8230;Praying Hands In God&#8217;s hands lies a heart, a life that changed the world&nbsp;<strong>Praying hands symbolize obedience, submission, sincerity, repentance, veneration, and respect in regard to one&#8217;s higher power.</strong> The exact meaning of praying hands varies depending on which religious tradition is considered.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><strong>Praying hands tattoos Design Variations of the Tattoo</strong></a></p><p>The praying hands tattoo works well alone.

The traditional significance of a koi fish tattoo can vary depending on the fish’s orientation (whether it is going up or down your body) and color. You want to be sure that your koi fish tattoo conveys the desired meaning.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">Koi fish Tattoos</a> are prominent in the work of Japanese tattoo artists because of a long-standing legend of how the fish become dragons. Most of the meaning and symbolism behind the fish stems from this ancient legend. Beliefs about the meaning and direction a koi fish is swimming in vary greatly. Some theories of what it means are actually contradictory. But, if you are using a koi in your tattoo, you can choose the meaning that applies to you. Tattoos are your form of self-expression.</p><p>Koi fish are capable of adapting to many different climates and water conditions and can symbolize strength. It is inherent in a koi&#8217;s nature to swim upstream. Through the koi fish legend, you can see that they show great determination, dedication, perseverance, and success.</p><p>The black koi is associated with successfully overcoming an obstacle. This symbol is great for those who have gone through a tough battle in life and have finally made it to a place of strength. These obstacles can include depression, drug addiction, an abusive relationship, and many other situations.</p><p>Koi fish tattoos often incorporate various symbols, such as the yin-yang symbol, water, and fire, dragons, or lotus flowers.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/koi-fish-tattoo/">Koi Fish Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

This large, blackbird has long been one of the smartest animals on earth, a lover of shiny objects, and perhaps even an intuitive trickster.</p><p>Wolf tattoos are very popular and consider to be the mainstream tattoos. They can be design in a variety of different ways and portrayed with different elements and symbols. Just like all animal tattoos, the wolf tattoo represents the traits and attributes of the wolf. The wolf is a very symbolic creature that holds deep meaning for many different cultures. Throughout history, most notably with Native Americans. To numerous tribes across North America and in other parts of the world, wolves are very powerful and important.</p><p>The eye of Providence design is also by the secret society of the Free Masons, DARPA. And on the official seal of Colorado.</p><p>The all-seeing eye’s usage by government entities, the Federal Reserve, and secret societies. Which led some to believe that the symbol also holds a darker connotation.</p><p>Those who follow this line of thought believe that the all-seeing eye is used as a subconscious marker or a way to denote covert control of the world by a group of ultra-elite oligarchs, leaders of industry and politicians, known as the “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><span class="s1">illuminati</span></a>”, or “enlightened ones”.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/wolf-tattoo/">Wolf Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bhagat Singh Tattoo &#8211; He was born to Vidyavati Kaur and Sardar Kisan Singh Sandhu. In a Sikh Jat family on 28 September 1907 in Lyallpur, Punjab in British India. His family had earlier involved in revolutionary activities against the British Raj.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">His uncle Swaran Singh had participated in the freedom struggle against the British.</a> When in 1907, another uncle of Bhagat. Ajit Singh was arrested and exiled to Rangoon in Burma (Myanmar), Swaran asked the people of Punjab to force the government for his release and due to his efforts, Ajit Singh was released from Rangoon jail in October 1907.</p><p>After coming back from jail, Ajit Singh decided to start a major revolt against the British. He began agitating the farmers and peasants to start a movement against them.</p><p>The British came to know of his intentions arrested him on 13 January 1911, when he was attending the Lohri festival celebration at his relative&#8217;s house. In February, Ajit Singh escaped from jail and ran away home, only to inform about his planning to start a mass struggle abroad in India. Ajit Singh bid farewell to his family and fled to Iran in March.</p><p>In 1912, Bhagat joined the District Primary School in Lyallpur received his elementary education there till class IV.&nbsp; When he was in 8th standard, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place.</p><p><strong>The very next day (on 14th April) he went to the bagh telling at his home that he was going to school.</strong></p><p>After running about 12 miles from Lahore, Bhagat reached Amritsar. At 2 pm as the boy Bhagat entered the bagh&#8217;s compound he saw blood scattered all over the ground. The turbans and torn clothes of people laid lifeless on the ground. The walls of the compound were red with blood. As it was a curfew in Punjab those days, the blood hadn&#8217;t been cleaned. Bhagat had taken a glass bottle with him before leaving from home. He took a handful of blood-stained soil and put it in the bottle. He reached home and put the bottle on in front of the Sikh gurus portrait and prayed to him for peace and solace for the victims of the massacre and he pledged to teach the British a lesson.</p><p>In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-cooperation movement to encourage a mass protest against the British and to boycott their trade in India, and to end their cooperation with British rule. Many people joined the movement and discarded the use of foreign goods and clothes. The people boycotted schools and colleges. The factories, industries, shops &amp; hospitals run by the government were all boycotted. Many students who left British schools joined Indian schools.</p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/">Bhagat Singh actively participated in the movement. He along with a group of people used to burn foreign clothes publicly. And used to boycott foreign schools, he was only 13 years old.</a></p><p>In February 1922, In Chauri Chaura village of Gorakhpur in the United Provinces. Some policemen beat down non-violent protesters going to picket a liquor shop at night.&nbsp; This created much chaos around the common people as they thought that if Gandhi had not suspended the movement they would have easily gained freedom.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/bhagat-singh-tattoo/">Bhagat Singh Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">The significance<b>&nbsp;of Crescent Moon on Lord Shiva’s Head</b></a></p><p>Shiva Tattva is where there is no mind and the moon signifies the mind. When there is no mind then how can this ‘no-mindedness’ be expressed and how can anybody understand it? You need a little bit of the mind to understand, experience and to express.<br>The no-mind, infinite consciousness requires that little bit of mind to express itself in the manifest world. So, to express that inexpressible, that little mind (crescent moon) is on the head.<br>Wisdom is beyond the mind, but it needs to be expressed with a tinge of mind and this is symbolized by the crescent moon.</p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/blog/"><b>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Damru</b></a></p><p><b>Damru</b> symbolizes the Universe which is always expanding and collapsing. From an expansion, it collapses and then it re-expands, this is the process of creation.<br>If you see your heartbeat, it is not just one straight line but it is a rhythm that goes up and down. The whole world is nothing but rhythms; energy rising and collapsing to rise again. So the damru signifies that. Look at the shape of the damru, from expansion it collapses and again expands.</p><p>The&nbsp;darmru&nbsp;is also a symbol of sound. Sound is rhythm and sound is energy. The whole universe is nothing but a wave function, it is nothing but rhythms. What does quantum physics say? It says the same thing – the whole universe is nothing but rhythms. It is just one wave (Adviata). So the&nbsp;damru&nbsp;signifies the non-dual nature of the universe.</p><p><b>Significance of Serpent around Lord Shiva’s Neck</b></p><p>A state of samadhi where there is nothing, just the inner sky of consciousness, is Shiva; where there is alertness and no action. To describe this alertness they put a snake around Shiva’s neck. So the&nbsp;<b>serpent</b>&nbsp;is a symbol of&nbsp;<b>alertness</b>.</p><p>In the state of meditation when the eyes are closed, it gives the impression that the person is sleeping, but he is not asleep, he is alert. To express this state of consciousness, a&nbsp;<b>snake</b>&nbsp;is shown around Lord Shiva’s neck.</p><p><b>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Trishul (Trident)</b></p><p><b>Trishul</b> represents the three aspects of consciousness – waking, dreaming and sleeping, and it represents the three Gunas – satva, rajas and tamas. Holding a Trishul (Trident) signifies that Shiva (the divinity) is above all the three states – waking, dreaming and sleeping, yet is the upholder of these three states.<br>The divinity is beyond the three gunas, but it holds the three Gunas together.</p><p><b>Shul</b> means problems or suffering. <b>Trishul</b> means that which destroys all kinds of suffering.</p><p><strong>Three types of pain that arise in life:</strong></p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Aadibhautik (physical)</li><li>Aadhyaatmik (spiritual) and</li><li>Aadidaivik (ethereal)</li></ol><p>What relieves you from all the problems and suffering is the Trishul. And it is in the hand of Shiva.</p><p>Also, view our large portfolio of <a href="/portfolio_category/lord-shiva-tattoos/">Shiva Tattoos</a>.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/shiva-tattoo-on-chest/">Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Karma Tattoo &#8211; Karma is the</b> universal law that applies to each and every one of us.</p><p>It <b>means</b> simply that everything you <b>do</b> will come back to you.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/">This <b>tattoo is the</b> reminder that Good <b>karma</b> comes from truly good actions. &#8230; It doesn&#8217;t work so well when you <b>do</b> good things, but for completely selfish reasons.</a></p><p>Karma is a key component of many Eastern religions and philosophies, including Hinduism, Buddhism and even Taoism. Remember that harming none includes harming yourself! &nbsp;This tattoo is the reminder that Good karma comes from truly good actions. It doesn’t work so well when you do good things, but for completely selfish reasons. And it absolutely does not work when you do things only for the purpose of getting a karmic reward.</p><p>Karma is in general formed by the combination of a person&#8217;s actions and intents. It depends not only on what the person actually does but also by the nature of their inner self.</p><p>The traditional, philosophical uses of karma have helped to connect the word. With a sense of &#8220;cosmic justice&#8221; in the Western vocabulary. In this sense, karma is often to refer to a mystic. The indefinable force that influences one&#8217;s immediate future. Western usage includes two distinct types of karma. There&#8217;s &#8220;good karma,&#8221; which one generates by doing good deeds and treating others well, and &#8220;bad karma,&#8221; which one creates by being inconsiderate and treating others poorly.</p><p><strong>Having a net amount of &#8220;good karma&#8221; will lead to good fortune in the future. While a net sum of &#8220;bad karma&#8221; will lead to hardship or bad luck.</strong></p><p>The belief in rebirth, or <a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/"><span class="s1">samsara</span></a>, as a potentially endless series of worldly existences in which every being is caught up was already associated with the doctrine of karma in pre-Buddhist India, and it was accepted by virtually all Buddhist traditions. According to the doctrine, good conduct brings a pleasant and happy result and creates a tendency toward similar good acts. While bad conduct brings an evil result and creates a tendency toward similar evil acts.,</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/karma-tattoo-2/">Karma Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>History and Background</b></p><p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">Lord Krishna</a>, the eighth avatar of God Vishnu is worshiped as a supreme God in Hinduism. Born in northern India (around 3,228 BCE), Lord Krishna’s life marks the passing of the Dvapara age and beginning of the Kal yuga (which is also considered as the current age).Krishna Tattoo</p><p>References to Lord Krishna can be found in several Hindu mythological books, especially in the epic Hindu book, the Mahabharata.</p><p>Lord Krishna is also described as an important figure in the Bhagavata Purana. This is another Hindu epic book that dates to the 10th century B.C. In the text, Lord Krishna is described as the charioteer for the warrior Arjuna who had guided him morally and gave military counsel to the leader.</p><p>The divine birth</p><p>There came a time when Mother Earth was unable to bear the sins and cruelty committed by evil kings and rulers. Mother Earth then prayed to Lord Brahma, the creator of the Universe, to relieve her from these sinful kings. Lord Brahma prayed to the supreme Lord Vishnu for reincarnation and to relieve the Mother Earth from these evil rulers. Lord Vishnu accepted the request and assured to defeat tyrannical forces.</p><p>The ruler of Mathura, Kansa was one such evil king. He had a sister named Devaki, who was married to Vasudeva. The day Devaki and Vasudeva got married, a voice from the sky forecasted that Devaki&#8217;s eighth son will bring an end to Kansa’s rule and will kill him.Krishna Tattoo</p><p>Frightened Kansa held the couple. He then vowed that he will kill every child of Devaki and Vasudeva. Seeing their first seven children being killed by the cruel Kansa, the imprisoned couple feared giving birth to their eighth child.</p><p><strong>One night Lord Vishnu appeared before them.</strong></p><p>He told them that in the guise of their son, he will return and rescue them from Kansa&#8217;s autocracy.</p><p>The divine baby was born and the day he was born, Vasudeva found himself magically freed from prison. He ran away with the infant to a safer house and Lord Vishnu removed all the obstacles from Vasudeva&#8217;s path.</p><p>Vasudeva reached a house in Gokul, exchanged Lord Krishna with a new born girl of Yashoda and Nanda and returned to the prison with the girl child. As soon as Kansa came to know about the new-born, he again tried to kill the child. The infant ascends to the heavens and transformed into the goddess Yogamaya and said, &#8220;O foolish Kansa! What will you get by killing me? Your nemesis is already born.”Krishna Tattoo</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blackpoisontattoos/_created/">Krishna</a> was raised as a cowherd in Gokul and became a skilful musician. On his return to Mathura, he slayed Kansa and restored his father to power.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/krishna-tattoo-2/">Krishna Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackpoisontattoos.com/tattoo-portfolio/">The significance<b> of Crescent Moon on Lord Shiva’s Head</b></a></p><p>Shiva Tattva is where there is no mind and the moon signifies the mind. When there is no mind then how can this ‘no-mindedness’ be expressed and how can anybody understand it? You need a little bit of the mind to understand, experience and to express.</p><p>The no-mind, infinite consciousness requires that little bit of mind to express itself in the manifest world. So, to express that inexpressible, that little mind (crescent moon) is on the head.<br>Wisdom is beyond the mind, but it needs to be expressed with a tinge of mind and this is symbolized by the crescent moon.</p><p><b>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Damru</b></p><p><b>Damru</b>&nbsp;symbolizes the Universe which is always expanding and collapsing. From an expansion it collapses and then it re-expands, this is the process of creation.<br>If you see your heartbeat, it is not just one straight line but it is a rhythm that goes up and down. The whole world is nothing but rhythms; energy rising and collapsing to rise again. So the&nbsp;damru&nbsp;signifies that. Look at the shape of the&nbsp;damru, from expansion it collapses and again expands.</p><p>Lord shiva tattoo &#8211; The darmru is also a symbol of sound. Sound is rhythm and sound is energy. The whole universe is nothing but a wave function, it is nothing but rhythms. What does quantum physics say? It says the same thing – the whole universe is nothing but rhythms. It is just one wave (Adviata). So the damru signifies the non-dual nature of the universe.</p><p><b>Significance of Serpent around Lord Shiva’s Neck</b></p><p>A state of samadhi where there is nothing, just the inner sky of consciousness, is Shiva; where there is alertness and no action. To describe this alertness they put a snake around Shiva’s neck. So the&nbsp;<b>serpent</b>&nbsp;is a symbol of&nbsp;<b>alertness</b>.</p><p>In the state of meditation when the eyes are closed, it gives the impression that the person is sleeping, but he is not asleep, he is alert. To express this state of consciousness, a&nbsp;<b>snake</b>&nbsp;is shown around Lord Shiva’s neck.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackpoisontattoos/"><b>Significance of Lord Shiva’s Trishul (Trident)-Lord shiva tattoo</b></a></p><p><b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;represents the three aspects of consciousness – waking, dreaming and sleeping, and it represents the three&nbsp;gunas – satva, rajas&nbsp;and&nbsp;tamas. Holding a&nbsp;trishul&nbsp;(Trident) signifies that Shiva (the divinity) is above all the three states – waking, dreaming and sleeping, yet is the upholder of these three states.<br>The divinity is beyond the three gunas, but it holds the three&nbsp;gunas&nbsp;together.</p><p><b>Shul</b>&nbsp;means problems or suffering.&nbsp;<b>Trishul</b>&nbsp;means that which destroys all kind of suffering.<br>Three types of pain that arise in life:<br>1.&nbsp;Aadibhautik&nbsp;(physical)<br>2.&nbsp;Aadhyaatmik&nbsp;(spiritual) and<br>3.&nbsp;Aadidaivik&nbsp;(ethereal)<br>What relieves you from all the problems and suffering is the&nbsp;trishul. And it is in the hand of Shiva.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/lord-shiva-tattoo-4/">Lord Shiva Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The intricacy and abstract nature of Polynesian armband tattoo have led to their continued popularity for hundreds of years.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meaning of the gladiator tattoo for men is quite obvious, and it is known to every young man who once watched the eponymous film with Russell Crowe. The word itself derives from the Latin word “gladius”, which is translated as “sword”.</p><p>In those distant times, gladiators were enslaved people, slaves or soldiers and criminals taken prisoners during the battles. All of them were previously taught how to handle the sword correctly.</p><p><strong>Gladiator Tattoo</strong></p><p>As soon as gladiators got the necessary skills, they were confronted with each other. Such massacres resulted in the death of one of them. The bloody battles in Ancient Rome had been held in arenas for seven hundred years.&nbsp;At first, the Romans preferred to arrange such fights on holidays.</p><p>They wanted to satisfy the cruel god of war Mars in such a way. Over time, they began to hold such battles for entertainment without much reason. The Romans borrowed offering up sacrifices in the form of gladiatorial games from the Egyptians, Etruscans, and Greeks. This is easily explained by the fact that various peoples, who either were conquered or voluntarily joined, lived throughout the Empire.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/gladiator-tattoo/">Gladiator Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
