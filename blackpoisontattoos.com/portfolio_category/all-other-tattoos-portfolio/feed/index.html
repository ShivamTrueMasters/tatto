										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The History of the Dove Symbol</strong></p><p>The dove ranks as one of the most widely-known symbols around the world, universally representing peace and love. Due to the symbol’s wide recognition, these tattoos are popular all around the globe.</p><p><strong>The dove embodies a variety of positive meanings.</strong></p><p><strong>Enduring Love</strong>. Because doves mate with one partner for the duration of their lives and also take care of their young together, they represent steadfast love and devotion. The bond between the mated pair is a lifelong, enduring, and faithful partnership.</p><p><strong>Mythological Significance</strong>. The dove is also mentioned in Greek and Roman mythology: the Greek goddess Aphrodite, the goddess of love and fertility, was said to ride in a chariot borne by doves. Her seven daughters (known as the Pleiades) are referred to as a flock of doves in Greek mythology. Some tribes believed that the spirits of the dead are transformed into doves. Some American Indians may use the dove tattoo to represent this association.</p><p><strong>Dove and Rose Tattoo</strong></p><p><strong>Peace and Harmony.</strong>&nbsp;Since early Christianity, the dove holding an olive branch in its beak has represented a symbol of peace. Ironically, the image of a dove holding a grenade has become quite popular as well.</p><p><strong>Holy Spirit.</strong>&nbsp;The dove is commonly associated with Jesus and Christianity. Many examples of Christian art depict Jesus accompanied by a flock of doves. Doves are mentioned often in the Bible, for example in the story of Noah&#8217;s Ark. Before the great flood, God ordered Noah to build a ark for him and his family and to gather all the animals in pairs, one male and one female. God then flooded the earth and everything was destroyed. After several weeks at sea, Noah sent out a dove and a raven to look for signs of land. When the dove returned with an olive branch in its beak, this was a sign that life would start over.</p><p><strong>The Messenger</strong>. There are many stories about the dove carrying messages, sometimes messages from God, sometimes love letters. The dove is commonly interpreted as a portent of love, victory, peace, or God&#8217;s will.</p><p><strong>Peace and Harmony.</strong>&nbsp;Since early Christianity, the dove holding an olive branch in its beak has represented a symbol of peace. Ironically, the image of a dove holding a grenade has become quite popular as well.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/dove-and-rose-tattoo/">Dove and Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roses are a complex flower and a popular tattoo. Obvious symbolism may be delicate&nbsp;beauty or&nbsp;love, but there is a wealth of culture behind rose symbolism that can be different based on different elements, including color and whether or not the rose is “open.”</p><p>The number of petals on a rose is commonly associated with&nbsp;numerology.</p><p>In mythology, Aphrodite (the Greek goddess of love) was often depicted with roses adorning her head, feet, and neck. This can be interpreted many ways, but the association comes from a rose bush that grew within a pool of blood spilled by her slain lover (Adonis), and so a common interpretation is that the rose symbolizes&nbsp;<strong>an immortal love</strong>&nbsp;that withstands time and even death.</p><p>Roses are not only a beautiful flower but have been the popular choice for both men and women for a tattoo since the 1930’s; but what does the rose symbolize.&nbsp; Your first thought may be in regard to its delicate beauty or its representation of love, inner and outer beauty and whilst you would be right there is also so much more to this beautiful flower.</p><p>As a depiction of love it can be a symbol of being in love particularly when the rose is without thorns, or with as a reminder that love does not come without certain sacrifices when the thorns are present. So even the thorns have their meaning, some say that when thorns are present on the tattoo it means the person does not place a great deal of emphasis on outer beauty, whilst for others, the tattoo refers to endless beauty with the thorn meaning you can look but you can’t touch.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo History</strong></p><p>The rose originated in Persia it is a masculine symbol, Over the years. It has become associated with femininity, however, the flower is popular with both men and women. Although the rose tattoo carries a plethora of meanings today, it used to only represent love.</p><p><strong>Rose Tattoo Meaning</strong></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Rose and Skull: </strong>The skull is a strong symbol of overcoming challenges or the death of an enemy. Combined with the rose, this tattoo is a representation of life after death—conquering an enemy and starting a new life. The most famous design depicts a rose growing out of a skull&#8217;s eye sockets. Some people like having the skull wearing the rose on its head.</li><li><strong>Anchor and Rose: </strong>This is a classic nautical tattoo that represents the commitment to a loved one.</li><li><strong>Rose and Dagger:</strong> These two contrasting elements can make for a visually striking tattoo that is imbued with profound meaning. The dagger stands for betrayal, ruthlessness, and death. A tattoo design that depicts a dagger stabbing a rose could represent the wearer&#8217;s belief that evil always conquers innocence. It could also symbolize heartbreak, especially if you add a few blood drops falling from a drooping rose. A dagger tattoo with rose vines wrapped around it represents the duality of human life and our constant struggle with good and evil. A tattoo of a rose&#8217;s thorny vines choking a dagger means that good always trumps evil or that true love is possible after a heartbreak.</li><li><strong>Rose and Clock:  </strong>A tattoo design that has a clock with no hands and a rose symbolizes endless love. Combined with the rose, this design could be a symbol of a certain romance in your past. Or it could represent an anniversary date.</li><li><strong>Rose and Dove:</strong> Dove tattoos are usually tributes to someone who has passed away. A rose and dove tattoo design can serve as a tribute to a loved one who has gone.</li></ul><p><strong>Symbol of balance</strong></p><p>A&nbsp;<strong>yellow rose</strong>&nbsp;symbolizes joy, protection against envious lovers, and a mature love.</p><p><strong>White roses</strong>&nbsp;symbolize purity, mysticism, and a secret admirer.</p><p><strong>Red roses </strong>symbolize romance or passionate love,&nbsp; also represent sacrifice or memorial.</p><p><strong>Pink roses</strong>&nbsp;are representative of healing, first love, and innocence.</p><p><strong>Blue roses</strong>&nbsp;signify the unattainable or the impossible.</p><p><strong>Black roses</strong>&nbsp;are a symbol of death and farewell. (This is not necessarily morbid; it can carry a message of a memorial.)</p><p>#tattoopins #botanicalflower #tattooartist #tattoomoscow #tattooinrussia #graphictattoo #wowtattoo #tattsketches #tattoodesign #moscowtattoo #equilattera #tattooselection #inkspiretattoos #womantattoo #taot #rostratattoo #tattooapprentice #tattooflash #sisterstattoo #sister #blackandgreytattoo #tattooshop #pinnacletattoo #colortattoo #weldertattoo #weldingtattoo #blackandgreysociety #blackandgreytattoos #customtattoos #skulltattoo</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/rose-tattoo/">Abstract Rose Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The compass tattoo has been a popular choice among a majority of cultures for centuries. This maritime symbol was popular among early sailors. Getting a compass tattoo would protect them. On rough waters and ensure that you would return home safely.</p><p>One of the main reasons sailors opted for this tattoo was that of protection. As a token of good luck, images of compasses painted on the ships as well. The seas were rough and unforgiving. Often times ships and the men onboard would disappear without a trace so these images served as a beacon of hope that they would be guided out of the treacherous waters alive.</p><p>Compass tattoos can come in a variety of styles and variations. These include,&nbsp;star compass, astrocompass, lodestone compass, Vegvisir compass and prismatic compass.</p><p><strong>The star compass is the most popular of the aforementioned designs and is said to represent the North Star.</strong></p><p>Before maps and technology existed, humans used the North Star to guide them in the right direction. Because of this, this style of tattoo stands for guidance, direction and finding a way home.</p><p>A way of depicting this is to include an image of a clock or hourglass with the compass in the tattoo design. Maps and earth play a role as well as maps, like compasses, help a user determine their location.</p><p>Compass tattoos have also represented the ideal of following one’s dreams. It is symbolic of staying your course in life and to not give up no matter how rough things may seem. The compass will guide you where you need to be.</p><p>Overall, this type of tattoo conveys guidance and direction, but you may add additional design elements to your tattoo to have it depict a meaning that is significant to you.</p><p>#compasstattoo #ClockAndCompassTattoo #Compass #tattoo #tattoos #girlswithtattoos #tattooed #tattooartist #tattooart #tattooedgirls #guyswithtattoos #instatattoo #tattoolife #tattoodesign #traditionaltattoo #tattooflash #tattooist #tattoogirl #handtattoo #tattooedgirl #sleevetattoo #tattooing #tattooshop #blacktattoo #chesttattoo #tattoosofinstagram #rosetattoo #blackandgreytattoo #tattoomodel #tattooer #colortattoo</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/compass-tattoo/">Compass Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazing Cover-Up Bird Feather Tattoo Inked By Black Poison Tattoos</p><p>The feather tattoo is one of the most sought after tattoo design given its cultural symbolism and heritage. The feather tattoo comes in different styles and designs and has quite a rich background with meaning which mostly depicts the character of the bird it’s taken from. Feather tattoos carry such a unique unisex tattoo element that normally holds symbolic meanings like the ability to take flight either emotionally, spiritually or creatively.</p><p>Some feather tattoo designs are quite distinct and elegant, effectively reflecting the characters of different species of birds they are derived from. Having a feather tattoo of an eagle, ostrich, peacock or any other bird intuitively identifies with the bird’s character. Some feathers of specific birds like the eagle are deemed to have some sacred attributes. Another dominant symbol of a feather tattoo is the aspect of freedom, due to the fact that a feather can easily fly in the wind. Peacock feather is popular with women tattoo lovers given it’s beauty and the array of colours it has.</p><p>If you have a few tattoos, there&#8217;s a good chance you have one or two you don&#8217;t like. Whether it was a backyard scratcher offering cheap tattoos, an impulse purchase to declare a love that has now got a new girlfriend, or it&#8217;s just plain ugly, we all have one.</p><p>We all have regrets and should-of-could-of moments. Considering that tattoos are forever, a bad tattoo will remind you, every time you change your clothes, of the tragedy on your skin.</p><p>Initially, you probably thought a tattoo was a one-off opportunity, and technically that is the case. Luckily, there are truly talented tattoo artists currently working within the industry worldwide. So bearing that in mind, there is the hope that maybe you could get a fantastic cover-up done.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/amazing-cover-up-bird-feather-tattoo/">Amazing Feather Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Realistic Eye Tattoo Inked By Black Poison Tattoos</strong></p><p>We know how much realistic eye tattoos are your worst nightmares… So let’s be a bit sadistic! Realistic eye tattoos are unconscious calls to our phobias, especially insects and pest. One of the most fragile part of our body and one of the most important, we are afraid to everything dangerous and sharp coming too close of it. But eyes are so fascinating, such powerful symbols, especially in esotericism. You already have seen all these people in comments screaming “Illuminati!” each time they see an eye and a triangle…</p><p>The Eye as a tattoo subject is becoming a trend nowadays and we see great potential in it! It symbolizes an open mind: all-seeing and aware. It signifies wisdom, clear thinking &amp; the presence of light – for without light we see nothing. The Eye can also mean awakening of who we truly are – that we are all really deathless souls having human experiences.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/realistic-eye-tattoo/">Realistic Eye Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ancient Greek Warrior Helmet Tattoo &#8211; Inked By Black Poison Tattoos</strong></p><p>Enemies of the Leading Greek city states met instant defeat fighting again the near untouchable Spartan army. Their mastery of battle skills, warfare tactics and combat strength were virtually unsurpassed until the Battle of Leuctra.</p><p>At one point in time, the Spartans fared as not only the strongest but also most efficient warriors.</p><p>Thanks to the battle of Thermopylae against the Persians, their military prowess gained considerable fame. Perhaps you’ve seen the movie 300, which depicts 300 Spartan hoplites holding back an entire army.</p><p>Though not the end victor against the massive opposing forces, they still left behind a considerable lengthy trail of their enemies blood.</p><p>During battle, they were armed with the dory, which is a large spear, a chest plate, bronze cuirasses, leg grave and a helmet. Not to mention, these soldiers also carried a small sword for close combat.</p><p>Now, if that sounds like a considerable amount of gear, just remember that the Spartans also fought with a hoplite shield called the Aspis.</p><p>In terms of symbolism, you could attribute it to the pinnacle of being one of the most lethal and feared warriors. Unrivaled bravely, incredible sheer strength and stamina, and a relentless drive for victory paint their picture quite well.</p><p>Regardless of your interpretation or meaning, just about every man can respect the authority and power they once commanded. To help you visualize their battles, I’ve put together a guide of the top 50 best Spartan tattoo designs for men. You’ll discover masculine ideas and witness incredible acts of war!</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/ancient-greek-warrior-helmet-tattoo/">Warrior Helmet Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
