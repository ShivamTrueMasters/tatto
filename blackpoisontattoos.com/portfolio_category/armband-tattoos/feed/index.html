										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peony symbolizes wealth, good fortune, and prosperity. Peony is a strong symbol of beauty, fragility and transitory nature of existence. Furthermore, they depict that getting great rewards is only possible by taking great risks.</p><p>When you combine the beauty of a&nbsp;flower with the edginess of a wrist tattoo you have a winning combination for a feminine and unique design. Flower tattoos remain a popular choice for many reasons.</p><p>Adding to their obvious beauty is the individual meanings of the flowers. Some flowers represent love and friendship, while others have associations of new life and peace. While their personal significance may remain a secret, their beauty can be shared with others. Whether you adore a certain blossom for its true beauty or appreciate the sentiment behind it, the following wrist tattoo ideas are perfect for brainstorming your first or next petaled tattoo.</p><p>The pairing is known as Karajishi and the lion’s ferocity is tempered by the peony’s beauty.</p><p><strong>Peony Tattoo</strong></p><p>Peony is a flower with a deep history of veneration and cultivation for many centuries. For example in China and Japan, the peony is a symbolic floral with similar meaning to the lotus, chrysanthemum and cherry blossom.</p><p>Peony is a symbol of wealth. Also remember that in China and Japan people used stone lions to guard sacred places, homes, Palaces, and temples and therefore the peony and the lion combination are not accidental.</p><p>Peony can be placed as a tattoo design in various way. They may portray the peony flower alone or combined with other elements and symbols. Peony was&nbsp;deep red in color as a tattoo design. Over time, the tattoo designs changed to include peonies in shades of orange, white, yellow and pink.</p><p>Furthermore, Peony flower tattoos may portray purple and blue color. As a result, you should be able to select the color that you want.</p><p>If you are more into color symbolism, you should be able to select a color that will represent you.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/flower-wrist-band-peony-tattoo/">Flower Wrist Band Peony Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though the designs are plenty, their symbolism in nature is subtle in their essence. There are always deeper meanings hidden between the lines of nature in the real life. And you should, therefore, try to do some research to understand the meaning of each design you intend to ink on your body.</p><p>Today, we can also take our cue from the forebears. We have powerful tools for psychic growth among the seas, skies and the trees. At every turn, our intuitive eyes feast upon the nature surrounding us, elevates us and most importantly transports our potentially transcendental perception.</p><p><strong>Minimalist Tattoo, Nature symbolism has no limit.</strong></p><p>And therefore, there are no set limits to the spiritual growth, higher knowledge, and the profound unfolding. You can come up with a tattoo design by recognizing what surrounds you.</p><p>You will remain with the tattoo design for the rest of your life. And therefore you have to clearly understand what you want to get. Whether you intend to go for nature tattoos, or any other type, research on it and know whether you will be comfortable with it in some years to come.</p><p>Furthermore, think about the significance of the tattoo design on you.</p><p>If you have fallen in and out of similar designs in the past.</p><p>Then wait for some time before having it inked on you.</p><p>But if you are thinking about something that symbolizes or has ever given you hope in tough times, then you should decisively go for it.</p><p>It is a popular design since it paints the picture of what trees symbolizes. Trees are strong support systems for our abundant life.</p><p>Trees symbolize strong system for the abundant life and fruitful existence which begets vitality and means to continue.</p><p>The mighty oak tree design is a mighty decorative piece and has a rifer meaning than the palm tree. It is among the most long-lasting tattoo designs in the human race. In ancient times, individuals used the tree for religious purposes and it is also considered to be a feature of courage.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/minimalist-tattoo/">Minimalist Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazing <strong>Maori Armband Tattoo</strong></p><p>Maori tattoos are begin in New Zealand. They started from a love affair between a very young man called Mataora and a princess whose name was Niwareka who was from the underworld. It is said that Mataora beat Niwareka which resulted to Niwareka going back to her father’s home. Mataora was left alone and during this period, he griefed having hit Niwareka and decided to look for her. He went and begged for forgiveness and Niwareka accepted it. Mataora tattooed this form of Maori tattoo as a reminder to avoid evil actions of beating his wife.</p><p><strong>Meaning of Maori Tattoos</strong></p><p>Maori tattoos had great significance among the maori tribe. One of the main meanings of this type of tattoo is the world beyond.&nbsp;This is very important to some people who belief by having such symbolism in their body, it will keep them off diseases or any disaster that may befall them.</p><p><strong>Polynesian Tattoo Dictionary</strong></p><p><strong>Enata:</strong>&nbsp;this Polynesian motif symbolizes both humans and gods. A reversed enata symbolizes an enemy.</p><p><strong>Lizard:&nbsp;</strong>also portrayed as a gecko, this tattoo design represents a creature with the power to communicate with gods. That a lizard tattoo design brings good fortune to the wearer.</p><p><strong>Marquesan Cross:</strong>&nbsp;based off of the turtle’s shell, this abstract tattoo design symbolizes the balance between the elements, as well as universal harmony.</p><p><strong>Ocean:</strong>&nbsp;the Polynesians believed that the ocean was their final destination, the place where they would go to die. Hence, the ocean came to symbolize death and the world beyond. Since these people relied so heavily on the water as a source of nutrition, it also represents fertility abundance.</p><p><strong>Shark Teeth:</strong>&nbsp;also known as ‘niho mano,’ the shark tooth is a popular Polynesian symbol. As such, the shark tooth has come to represent guidance, shelter, and power.</p><p><strong>Shells:</strong>&nbsp;both turtle shells and seashells are important Polynesian symbols. Generally, they represent longevity, wellness, fertility, and peace.</p><p><strong>Spearheads:</strong>&nbsp;these geometric designs are an expression of courage in battle. A line of spearheads facing the same direction represent the defeat of the enemy.</p><p><strong>Sun:</strong>&nbsp;as the most important element of Polynesian society, the sun stands for richness, brilliance, and rebirth.</p><p><strong>Tiki:</strong>&nbsp;this human-like figure represents the Polynesian semi-gods.</p><p>#polynesiantattoo #maoritattoo #polynesiantattoodesigns #maoritattoodesigns #polynesiantattoomeanings #maoritattoomeanings #polynesiansymbols #maorisymbols</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/maori-armband-tattoo/">Maori Armband Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solid Arm Band Tattoo by Black Poison Tattoos</p><p>If you are deciding on getting an armband tattoo you are in luck because there are so many options when it comes to this tattoo. Almost any idea that you have can be turned into an armband tattoo. Many people get tribal tattoos, Celtic tattoos and Polynesian tattoos in this area. So if you are thinking about getting a tribal, Celtic or Polynesian tattoo and are unsure of where you want to place it, consider getting this type of tattoo. Some people select an animal that they want to get tattooed and have it go around the arm, like a dragon tattoo which is a good armband tattoo option for men and women. A good armband tattoo idea for women is to get a ring of flowers around the arm. Colorful swirls and stars is another option that looks really nice. If you are a music lover you can have a tattoo of musical notes on a staff circling your arm. Armband tattoos can be thick or they can be skinny, they can be dark or they can be light. The possibilities are endless when it comes to getting an armband tattoo design for both men and women.</p><p>When most people think about armband tattoos, they think of it as being in only one place on the arm. Most armband tattoos are found around the bicep or upper arm area. However, it is also very common to get an armband tattoo on the lower arm, just below the elbow. Another location for this tattoo, though not as common as the previous two just mentioned, is around the wrist. Where you place your armband tattoo is up to you as it is all about personal preference any location on the arm can be just as good as any other.</p><p>Armband tattoo designs are not known for their meanings. Most people believe that an armband tattoo is simply chosen for its aesthetic value. And this true for the most part. However, there are meanings behind particular armband tattoos that you may not be aware of and can add more depth to your decision, or could make you reconsider getting your chosen tattoo design. For example, the very common barbed wire tattoo and the solid black armband tattoo are actually considered dark and even scary symbols in Russia and Japan, respectively. These symbols were often worn by convicts or mafia-type individuals. The location of where the armband was placed, especially for the Russian barbed wire tattoo, had just as much meaning as the barbed wire tattoo itself. However, the tough history behind armband tattoos can enhance the bad-boy attractiveness of men. On a brighter note, in Hawaii any water-based or themed armband tattoo may represent aboriginal Hawaiian pride. While most armband tattoos are selected solely based on their design, it is also useful to know the meaning behind why certain tattoo designs are chosen for this part of the body.</p><p>Armband tattoos are definitely one of the coolest places to get a tattoo. For men especially, they emphasize the bicep which is a highly regarded part of the body in female eyes. This tattoo is a popular option for women as well. Now that you know more about the flexibility this tattoo provides for tattoo design ideas, where this tattoo is most commonly placed on the arm and the meaning behind certain armband tattoos for men, you can start coming up with designs of your own that are unique, interesting, and meaningful.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/solid-arm-band-tattoo/">Solid Arm Band Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
