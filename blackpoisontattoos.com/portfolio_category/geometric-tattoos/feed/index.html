										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Symbolic Meaning of Arrow&nbsp;</b></p><p>Like all other tattoo designs, the arrow tattoo too has its own symbolic meaning, which needs to be understood before one opts for this tattoo. In the Native American culture, the arrow is considered as the weapon of protection and hunting, which has been used to safeguard one’s family as well as sustain them by making provision of food for them.</p><p><strong>In this culture, two crossed arrows also depict <span class="s1">friendship</span>, which is the reason why this symbol is a popular tattoo design for a friend.</strong></p><p>Though different kinds of arrow tattoo designs stand for different things. The basic meaning of an arrow tattoo is positivity.</p><p><strong>The bow, which stands for struggle in life, pulls one back but the arrow gets itself released from the bow to propel forward and seek better things in life.</strong></p><p>In other words, an arrow stands for achievements of one’s goals in life by overcoming all hardships. In the zodiac, a bow and an arrow stand for the astrological sign of Sagittarius.</p><p>It is also considered as the symbol of masculinity,&nbsp;<span class="s1">strength</span>, power, and sense of direction. It is about moving in only one direction, which is forward, without looking back in life.</p><p><b><strong>Placement of Arrow Tattoo</strong></b></p><p>An arrow tattoo is mostly in black simple lines. Though colors may use in some cases depending upon the choice of the bearer. Basically, it is the size of the tattoo which determines its placement. A small sized arrow tattoo can be inked on the&nbsp;<span class="s1">wrist</span>, ankle or&nbsp;<span class="s1">finger</span>, while a medium to bigger one can be done on the side, back, shoulder,&nbsp;<span class="s1">chest</span>, arm,&nbsp;<span class="s1">thigh</span>&nbsp;or leg. The prolonged shape of this kind of tattoo also makes it ideal to place along the spine.</p><p><b><strong>Popular Arrow Design</strong></b></p><p>Arrow tattoos come in different designs, out of which one can choose a design. According to its deeper symbolic meaning as well it&#8217;s aesthetic value. Here are some popular arrow tattoo designs:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li class="li4"><b>Single Arrow</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;One of the most widely used arrow tattoo designs is the solitary arrow. Which as in its common symbolism, points towards a direction. Another meaning of a single arrow is protection from the evil and negative forces.</li><li class="li4"><b>Two Arrows</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;As explained earlier, two arrows which cross each other stand for friendship as per the Native American culture. They can use as a matching tattoo with one’s best friend. On the other hand, two arrows which point away from each other depict war.</li><li class="li4"><b>Broken Arrow</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;In contract to arrow depicting war and protection, a broken arrow represents making peace.</li><li class="li4"><b>A Bundle of Arrows</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;A common arrow tattoo design shows a bundle of multiple arrows, usually five in number. These arrows bundled together to stand for unity and strength, as a single arrow can break easily. While it is hard to break a bundle of them.</li></ul><p><strong>Some other tattoo designs in arrow tattoos incorporate these arrows with elements.</strong></p><p>Like&nbsp;<span class="s1">feathers</span>,&nbsp;<span class="s1">dreamcatcher</span>,&nbsp;<span class="s1">anc</span><span class="s1">h</span><span class="s1">or</span>,&nbsp;<span class="s1">flowers</span>, diamonds, and hearts, each one having its own meaning, an arrow passing through a heart is a commonly seen design which shows broken heart and pain in love. On the other hand, an arrow passing through a diamond signifies courage and positivity.</p><p>which takes a person on the path of success in life.</p><p>An arrow can also do along with a compass or Nautical Star for representing direction. Another popular arrow tattoo design feature a bow with an arrow strung on it, ready to shot.</p><p><strong>Arrow tattoos were originally based on Native American tribal life, hundreds of years ago.</strong></p><p>The arrow represented an essential tool in hunter-gatherer communities, serving as a weapon in hunting and in war. Though a simple design, this symbol is extremely popular because of the powerful, positive meanings associated with it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/arrow-feather-tattoo/">Arrow with Feather Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

The dots at the end of the symbol represent death, or the moment we fade to nothing. There are multiple designs for unalome tattoos, or you can create your own and add your own elements, such as the lotus flower to represent new beginnings.</p><p>The&nbsp;<b>Unalome</b>&nbsp;is originally a Hindu symbol that graphically recalls Shiva´s third eye and it represents wisdom and the path to perfection. …</p><p>The Unalome Lotus Tattoo symbolizes overcoming adversities towards perfection.</p><p>Thus perfectly integrating the&nbsp;<b>meaning</b>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<b>Unalome</b>.</p><p><strong>Lotus Flower Meaning in Buddhism</strong></p><p>In Buddhism, the lotus is associated with purity, spiritual awakening and faithfulness. The flower is considered pure as it is able to emerge from murky waters in the morning and be perfectly clean.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Buddhism Culture</strong>&nbsp;– According to Buddhist religion, lotus defines purity and piousness of the soul, as the flower grows in a muddy area, yet maintains its purity. The belief is based on the fact that you will find a perfectly complete miniatures lotus plant within a seed, which implies that even a human being is born complete and yearns for perfection through his journey of life. Also, Buddhism has meanings for various colors of lotus flowers, as a red colored lotus stands for the heart, which implies love and passion. Similarly, a pink lotus represents devotion towards the divine, while a blue one stands for learning and intelligence. A white colored lotus implies purity and peace, both at spiritual as well as intellectual level.</li><li><strong>Chinese Culture</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese culture sees lotus as a flower with perfect beauty stands as a source of inspiration for poets and artists since times immemorial.</li><li><strong>Western Culture</strong>&nbsp;– The Western culture has a similar kind of reflection of this charming flower.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Wolf Head Tattoo</strong></p><p>Many different cultures throughout history, most notably with Native Americans: too numerous tribes across North America and in other parts of the world, wolves are very powerful and important.</p><p><strong>Wolves have survived in harsh locations for tens of thousands of years.</strong></p><p>They are intelligent and skillful hunters who rarely hunt alone (unless they have been cast out of the pack). Wolves live and hunt in packs, tight-knit family groups that increase their chances of survival.</p><p>Native Americans viewed the wolf as a totem animal or spirit sent to help guide us through life, symbolizing loyalty and perseverance. In legends, the wolf had great powers given by the Great Spirit. Wolves also had the power to change into people.</p><p><strong>The Wolf Head Tattoo is a very symbolic creature that holds deep meaning.</strong></p><p>Wolves are strongly associated with the family. Because they live and hunt in packs, they have survived. The pack also gives them a territorial advantage against other predators. A wolf will only mate with one partner while the pair is alive. Because they mate for life, and because the whole pack will help take care of the pups, wolves are also known as caring parents. Thus a wolf tattoo can symbolize tight family bonds.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/wolf-head-tattoo/">Wolf Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>3D Star Tattoo with Nice Words Inked by Black Poison Tattoos</p><p>Some nice words like friendship, freedom, family, love, and more are inserted into a large 3D star Tattoo.</p><p>Star tattoos can be nice and unique delegate of your inner personality and conviction. Star tattoo designs look cool and they are a good preference for a very first ink piece because a star is typically small in design and doesn’t need to be awfully intricate. These designs look attractive and generally they signify a change in life.</p><p>The star is one of the oldest classical cryptograms and it has been an important image in many cultures and religions. When human knew nothing about them, what actually they are, still they were very lovable by human. In the ancient times, human stared up at the sky and attempted to explain that superlative view with the help of myths and religion.</p><p>They are universal cryptograms, not attached to an exact religion or culture, and actually can mean plenty of unique things to plenty of unique people. Male and females have separate star tattoos designs prearranged for them. Females love the shooting stars since they look very feminine, whereas guys love the nautical stars since they look manly. Star tattoos can be drawn as a single star, solitary star, or as an assemblage of small stars, celestial, or nautical designs.</p><p>Star tattoos designs are very flexible and can mesh up with wings, skulls, moon &amp; sun, scroll, flowers, butterfly, fairy and we think almost every kind of image or symbol can be mesh up with stars with the aim of generating a unique and personal tattoo. If you are looking for unique star tattoos not those common or creepy designs.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/3d-star-tattoo/">3D Star Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sun, our primary source of life, has always been awe-inspiring. There are many reasons why a sun tattoo might be personally meaningful. The sun has had a religious and symbolic significance in many ancient cultures. Honoring the sun as a giver of life is an ancient and universal impulse, and may explain some of the popularity of sun tattoos.</p><p>Suns, moon and stars are by far some of the most fascinating subjects for both science and tattoo designs. A sun tattoo can be very significant to many people, in fact, it is one of the most popular design elements requested. The value of this design, in terms of symbolism, represents a very deep value for life itself. The symbolic and mystically design is amongst a favorite for both men and women. The individual manner in which the sun is drawn in body art has many interpretations. Providing a wealth of options as far as color and size, it would be pretty hard to find two people in the world with the same exact sun tattoo. For example, a sun tattoo can be simple, realistic, futuristic or tribal.</p><p>Tattoo meanings are highly personal, but sun tattoos generally stand for Strength, Growth, Fertility, Vitality, Endurance, Passion, Rebirth, Transformation.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com/portfolio/custom-sun-tattoo/">Custom Sun Tattoo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blackpoisontattoos.com">Black Poison Tattoos</a>.</p>
