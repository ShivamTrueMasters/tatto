It is told primarily through Srimad Bhagavatam, Garga Samhita, Visnu Purana, Brahmavaivarta Purana, Mahabharata, Harivamsa and several other Puranas. However, here are some of the broad strokes.<\/p><p>Krishna, in fact, took birth in a prison cell. A sage had told his egoistic uncle, King Kamsa, that he would be killed by his sister Devaki\u2019s child. So Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and had each child she bore murdered. However, Devaki, and her husband, Vasudeva, finally were able to sneak one child off to safety. This was Sri Krishna. They sent Krishna off to Vraja, where he was raised by a foster mother, Yasoda. It was in Vrindavan, one of the villages of Vraja, that Krishna won the hearts of the gopis, the cowherds of the village. \u201cBy spending all his time with the gopis of Vrindavan\u2014playing with them, joking with them, stealing their butter and milk, etc\u2014what he actually was doing was stealing their hearts,\u201d Amma says. It is from this that Krishna was given the name \u201cChitta Chora\u201d [one who steals the mind].<\/p><p><strong>Sri Krishna at Dwarka<\/strong><\/p><p>krishna tattoo, In later life, Sri Krishna retired to Dwarka where he lived for many years. Legend has it that Sri Krishna was killed by an arrow through his ankle when he was shot by a hunter, who mistook Sri Krishna for a deer. The ankle was the one area of weakness in Sri Krishna\u2019s body. He accepted death calmly, knowing his time on earth and come to an end.<a href=\"\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/513128951289262457\/?nic=1\">\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/513128951289262457\/?nic=1<\/a><\/p><p><br><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cThere have been very few who have been able to rejoice both in victory and in defeat,\u201d Amma says. \u201cSri Krishna is one who celebrated both life and death.
