As a bird, the owl has been linked to many things useful in giving the best meaning to your owl tattoo. Different cultures have attached different meanings to the owl tattoo. Some of the cultures that have found interest in the owl are the Egyptian, Celtic, and Hindu among others.<\/p><p>The ancient Greeks revered the goddess Athena, who was supposed to be the goddess of&nbsp;<strong>wisdom<\/strong>&nbsp;and guardian of the Acropolis. Her symbol was the owl, so the bird became a symbol of higher&nbsp;<strong>wisdom<\/strong>. The owl was a bird of prophecy and wisdom&nbsp;in many ancient cultures<\/p><p><strong>Symbol of wisdom, education, and intelligence<\/strong><\/p><p>Undeniably, the owl is a carrier of many symbols. However, this is not a big surprise because the bird\u2019s appearance is unique. It is rarely seen especially during the day. Mostly, it can be found at night, and therefore the beliefs can be many.
