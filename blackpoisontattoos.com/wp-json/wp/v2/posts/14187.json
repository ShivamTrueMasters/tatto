Roaring lions are born leaders, gifted fighters, and, in a crunch, are the persons who can best guide the group out of danger.&nbsp;<span class=\"s1\">According to <\/span><span class=\"s1\">t<\/span><span class=\"s1\">he tradition<\/span>, a lion whelp was still-born but brought to life by the roar of his father. The whelp later went on to create and lead the tribes of Israel. The symbolism shows that the word of the Divine (represented by the roaring Lion) has the power to breathe life into weakest being (the whelp) and transform him into a force to be reckoned with.
