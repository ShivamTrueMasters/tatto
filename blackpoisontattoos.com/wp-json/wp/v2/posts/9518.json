Japanese people have, for years, used Koi fish tattoo designs as a cultural symbol for overcoming adversity. Stories are told of how they climb waterfalls that have strong currents.One particular legend is the koi fish\u2019s claim to fame. An ancient tale tells of a huge school of golden koi swimming upstream the Yellow River in China.<\/p><p>Gaining strength by fighting against the current, the school glimmered as they swam together through the river. When they reached a waterfall at the end of the river, many of the koi turned back, letting the flow of the river carry them away.The remaining koi refused to give up. Leaping from the depths of the river, they attempted to reach the top of the waterfall to no avail. Their efforts caught the attention of local demons, who mocked their efforts and heightened the waterfall out of malice. After a hundred years of jumping, one koi finally reached the top of the waterfall.<\/p><p><strong>Koi Fish Meaning<\/strong><\/p><p>The koi fish is a symbol with extremely deep meaning for those who choose it as part of their body art. If you have been considering getting a tattoo that involves a koi fish, take the time first to learn the meaning associated with them.

You want to be sure that your koi fish tattoo conveys the desired meaning.<\/p><p>Koi fish have a very long history in Chinese and Japanese culture. They were originally common carp and were later domesticated and bred to produce certain colors. Chinese invaders brought koi to Japan, where the fish flourished. Koi fish are prominent in the work of Japanese tattoo artists because of a long-standing legend of how the fish become dragons. Most of the meaning and symbolism behind the fish stems from this ancient legend.<\/p><p>The gods recognized the koi for its perseverance and determination and turned it into a golden dragon.
