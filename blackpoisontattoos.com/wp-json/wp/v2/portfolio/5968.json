This is placed near the fiery third eye and this shows the power of Soma, the sacrificial offering, which is the representative of the moon. It means that Shiva possesses the power of procreation along with the power of destruction. The moon is also a measure of time, thus Crescent also represents his control over time.<\/p><p>The Cobra Necklace: This suggests that Shiva is beyond the powers of death and is often the sole support in case of distress. He swallowed the poison kalketu for the wellbeing of the Universe. The deadly cobra represents the death aspect that Shiva has thoroughly conquered. The cobras around his neck also represent the dormant energy, called Kundalini, the serpent power. The snake curled three times around the neck of Lord Shiva depicts the past, present, and future times. The snake looking in the right direction of Lord Shiva signifies that the Lord\u2032s perpetual laws of reason and justice preserve natural order in the universe.<\/p><p>The Vibhuti: Vibhuti is a three-line of ashes drawn on the forehead that signifies the Immortality of the soul and manifested glory of the Lord.<\/p><p>Tiger Skin: Lord Shiva is shown sitting on or wearing a tiger skin. The tiger is the vehicle of Shakti, the Goddess of power and force. Shiva is beyond and above any kind of force. He is the master of Shakti. The tiger skin that he wears symbolizes victory over every force. Tigers also represent lust. Thus sitting on Tiger skin, Shiva indicates that he has conquered lust.<\/p><p>The Elephant &amp; Deer Skin: Shiva also wears elephant skins. Elephants represent pride. Wearing elephant skin, Shiva indicates that he has conquered pride. Similarly, deer represent the flickering mind. Shiva wears deer skin which indicates that he has controlled the mind perfectly.<\/p><p><strong>Tags:<\/strong>&nbsp;#LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra Tattoo with Ohm Crescent: Shiva bears on his head the crescent of the Panchami (fifth day) moon.
