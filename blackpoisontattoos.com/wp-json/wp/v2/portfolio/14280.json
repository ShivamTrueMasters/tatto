Tattoos are like preserving and expressing love for as long as you are alive. Mothers and special and so they deserve a special place in your life and what better way than to keep her with you forever on a part of you. It is nothing but a sign of truly unbreakable bond.

Some mothers definitely do not want to see their children going through pain and getting a permanent tattoo is a little painful but if she sees that you went through that pain just because you love her, she would surely grow bigger with love.<\/p><p>Tattoos don\u2019t require words as they are a language on their own.<\/p><p>Today mother and daughter even get matching tattoos which are not only adorable but make other mother-daughter pairs envious. Sharing a common tattoo is a lot more personal and deep than just doing something together.<\/p><p>Mothers daughters and grandmothers nowadays have matching tattoos and this concept of generation tattoos is beautiful. Tattoos don\u2019t have to be large and colorful to convey feelings. Even a small, sweet tattoo is enough to show love and gratitude.<\/p><p>You can get a tattoo for your mom or with your mom to establish bond just as deep as blood bond. In case of mom tattoos or mother daughter tattoos, less is definitely more. No one else deserves a place on your body more than your mother because she kept you in her womb for nine months.<\/p><p>She nurtured you and cared for you not because she had any selfish interests but because she loves you with all her heart.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Someone rightly said once that God could not be anywhere and that is why he created mothers.
