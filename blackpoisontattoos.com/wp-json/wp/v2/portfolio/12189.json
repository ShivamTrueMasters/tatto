He became the designer of the Ur-Leica which he made two (possibly three) samples of in the period 1912-1913. With the purpose to test film stock and\/or lenses for movie films. Or perhaps because he couldn&#8217;t carry the traditional large plate cameras and wanted a smaller camera for him self. Barnack was a film geek and moving pictures was the new revolution back in early 1900&#8217;s.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cIn photography there is a reality so subtle that it becomes more real than reality.\u201d Ninety years ago, at the 1925 Leipzig Spring Fair in Germany,&nbsp; camera was launched that was destined to change the face of photography.
