He was the one that God sent to tell Our Blessed Lady that She was to become the Mother of God, the Mother of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Another Angel was called Raphael; he was the one who helped Tobias in the Bible. Another Archangel was called Michael. Michael was &#8220;the Angel of the Lord&#8221;, who was sent to Moses and Jacob and Abraham and to other people throughout the history of the world. Another Archangel was Lucifer, who was so beautiful that the other Angels called him the Son of the Morning.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>St Michael the archangel tattoo St Michael, known otherwise as Michael the Archangel, can be found fifteen times throughout the Bible.
