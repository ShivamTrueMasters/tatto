On the other hand, in Egyptian, Roman and Greek mythology, the eye on the peacock feather is considered to be the \u201cevil eye.\u201d This is not always a bad thing \u2013 the \u201cevil eye\u201d symbols give the evil eye, as well as, protect the one who wears them.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blackpoisontattoos.com\/\">Peacock Tattoo are generally a very beautiful and gentle feminine tattoo designs.<\/a><\/p><p>A lot of girls choose peacock feather simply because it is more beautiful than other feathers, while only a small number associates the feather to the meaning of peacock tattoos.<\/p><p>Feathers symbolize creativity, spiritual evaluation and rebirth.

It could be comprehended in two ways \u2013 the person wearing it could either be very proud of herself for good reasons, or simply very arrogant. If you don\u2019t want to be perceived as an arrogant person, I\u2019d suggest you choose a smaller tattoo. Rather than one that goes across your whole back.<\/p><p>The peacock is a very important bird for people in India. It still has a status of a worshiped bird, mainly because it slays snakes. That peacocks are immune to snake bites. Their blood to chase away evil spirits. Peacock feather tattoo can be a symbol of protection against those spirits. Or simply people who would like to hurt you.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Peacock Feather Tattoo \u2013 The peacock is known as the bird with 100 eyes, referring to the pattern on its tail feathers.
