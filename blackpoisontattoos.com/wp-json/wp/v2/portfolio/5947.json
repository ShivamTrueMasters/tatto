He is known as the third element in the Hindu Trinity (Trimurti), the other two members being Lord Brahma &#8211; the creator, and Lord Vishnu &#8211; the protector. Shiva is the destructive form of the Almighty. As the cycle of destruction and recreation is always in a circle, Shiva\u2019s primary responsibility is to maintain the life cycle. Scholars say, as the Mahakaal, Shiva destroys and dissolves everything into nothingness but as Shankara, he also reproduces that which has been destroyed and dissolved. His symbol of Lingam or the phallus represents this reproductive power.<br>Lord Shiva is also considered to be the most unique of all Hindu gods and also the God of all. A great ascetic, Shiva is the only godhead who is forever in deep meditation, totally absorbed in contemplation in His abode, Kailaasa Mountain in the great Himalaya. Lord Shiva is also said to be inseparable from Shakti &#8211; Parvati the daughter of Himavaan &#8211; Haimavati. There is no Shiva without Shakti and no Shakti without Shiva, the two are one &#8211; of the absolute state of being.<\/p><p>Shiva is often shown with many faces, as creator, destroyer, and preserver in total command of the cosmos. He contains both good and evil. He is moody, free of inhibitions, easy to please, protector of the downtrodden, and has the power to alter the laws of destiny. Thus, it is Lord Shiva who is known as the God of mercy and kindness. He protects his devotees from all evil that is always around us. He blesses his followers with grace, knowledge, and peace.<\/p><p>You may be interested in more <a href=\"\/portfolio_category\/lord-shiva-tattoos\/\">Shiva Tattoos<\/a>.<\/p><p><strong>Tags:<\/strong>&nbsp;#LordShivaTattoos #MahadevTattoos #NatarajaLordShivaTattoos #LordShivaTattoosinIndia #LordShivaTattooDesigns #IndianTattooArtist #MahayogiTattoos #TattoosofLordShiva #GodofDestructionTattoo #ReligiousTattoos #LordShivaTattooMeaning<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alluring Lord Shiva Tattoo with Trishul &amp; Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra Shiva (Sanskrit: Auspicious One) is one of the main deities of Hinduism that is worshipped as the paramount lord by the Shaivaite sects of India.
