When we think about them, we often think about wealth, luxury and fashion, even the higher quality of one&#8217;s life. Some people wear diamonds on their ring fingers while others wear them on their skin, having a micro dermally implanted diamond. Diamonds have decorated all types of ancient and royal crowns and are called a &#8220;<i>girl&#8217;s best friend.<\/i>&#8220;<\/p><p><b>History:<\/b>&nbsp;The word &#8220;diamond&#8221; is Greek in origin (<span class=\"s1\">\u1f00<\/span>\u03b4\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2\u2013<i>ad\u00e1mas<\/i>&nbsp;or &#8220;unbreakable&#8221;) and means strength and invincibility. They are made of a nearly indestructible mineral, created deep in the earth by massive pressure weighing down on carbon deposits and then brought up to the earth&#8217;s surface via volcanic eruptions. One of the earliest recorded accounts of diamonds was from India around 400 BC. Today, most come from Africa.<\/p><p><b>Beauty:<\/b>&nbsp;You&#8217;ll find diamonds in fashion magazines and on any red carpet or runway. There are sayings that equate these gems with inner beauty (like a &#8220;diamond in the rough&#8221;). which is apt, since they appear rough on the outside when first mined, but once they are polished, their beauty is revealed. To the tattoo wearer, the diamond may represent inner beauty, as in the saying, &#8220;true beauty is found on the inside.&#8221;<\/p><p><b>Power:<\/b>&nbsp;We often associate diamonds with wealth and the power that money can bring. The gem is very expensive and multiple diamonds may represent great wealth and value. They are extremely coveted items and some people will do anything to get their hands on them.<\/p><p><b>Words about Diamonds:<\/b>&nbsp;As I stated earlier, some tattoos incorporate famous quotes or personal words to underline and accentuate the meaning of the tattoo. These quotes may be placed on ribbons or&nbsp;<span class=\"s2\">banners<\/span>&nbsp;or inked inside or outside the diamond design. Another popular thing that people do is have the first letter of their own name. The name of a loved one inked inside the diamond.<\/p><p><b>Diamond as a Birthstone:<\/b>&nbsp;People born in April claim the diamond as their birthstone. A tattoo may be used to represent the month a person was born. Since diamonds are associated with the month of April. The gem might be used as a symbolic representation of anything or anyone that began that month.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most of us have owned or seen diamonds at some point.
