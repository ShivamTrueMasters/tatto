Shiva is often shown with many faces, as creator, destroyer and preserver in total command of the cosmos. He contains both good and evil. The main iconographical attributes of Shiva are the third eye on his forehead, the snake Vasuki around his neck, the crescent moon adorning, the holy river Ganga flowing from his matted hair, the Trishula as his weapon and the Damru as his musical instrument.He blesses his followers with grace, knowledge and peace.<span class=\"m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526Apple-converted-space m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blackpoisontattoos.com\/\"><strong>Om with Trishul armband<\/strong><\/a><\/p><p><span class=\"m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg\">As discuss above, that Shiva is the supreme Power in among all god.
