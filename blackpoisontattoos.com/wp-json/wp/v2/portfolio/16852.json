It is told primarily through Srimad Bhagavatam, Garga Samhita, Visnu Purana, Brahmavaivarta Purana, Mahabharata, Harivamsa and several other Puranas. However, here are some of the broad strokes.<\/p><p>Krishna, in fact, took birth in a prison cell. A sage had told his egoistic uncle, King Kamsa, that he would be killed by his sister Devaki\u2019s child. So Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and had each child she bore murdered. However, Devaki, and her husband, Vasudeva, finally were able to sneak one child off to safety. This was Sri Krishna. They sent Krishna off to Vraja, where he was raised by a foster mother, Yasoda. It was in Vrindavan, one of the villages of Vraja, that Krishna won the hearts of the gopis, the cowherds of the village. \u201cBy spending all his time with the gopis of Vrindavan\u2014playing with them, joking with them, stealing their butter and milk, etc\u2014what he actually was doing was stealing their hearts,\u201d Amma says. It is from this that Krishna was given the name \u201cChitta Chora\u201d [one who steals the mind].<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A child, a brother, a charioteer, a warrior, a disciple, a guru, a cowherd, a messenger, the beloved of the gopis\u2026 Throughout his life, Krishna enacted so many roles\u2014the whole time never forgetting.
