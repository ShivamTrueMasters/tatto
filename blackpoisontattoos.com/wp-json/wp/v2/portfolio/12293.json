Tattoos would indicate status in a hierarchical society as well as sexual maturity, genealogy and ones rank within the society.<\/p><p>However, the European navigators showed little interest due to the lack of valuable resources.<\/p><p>Captain James Cook (as mentioned in our comprehensive guide to Maori tattooing) was the first navigator trying to explore the aforementioned Polynesian triangle.<\/p><p>In 1771, when James Cook first returned to Tahiti and New Zealand from his first voyage, the word \u201ctattoo\u201d appeared in Europe.<\/p><p>He narrated the behaviors of the Polynesian people in his voyage, which he called tattaw. He also brought a Tahitian named Ma\u2019i to Europe. Since then tattoo started to become rapidly famous, predominantly because of the tattoos of Ma\u2019i.<\/p><p>Another legend is that European sailors liked the Polynesian tattoos. So much that they spread extremely fast in Europe because the sailors emblazoned the tattoos on their own bodies.<\/p><p>The actual tradition of Polynesian tattooing existed more than 2000 years ago. However, in the 18th century the Old Testament strictly banned the operation.&nbsp;But it became very difficult to sterilize the wooden and bone tools.<\/p><p>The revival of the art and practice of tattooing, particularly in Tonga in recent years.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Spearheads are usually in combination with other symbols to express certain meanings.
