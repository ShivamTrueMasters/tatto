Scorpion tattoos are popular for both men and women.<\/p><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-black-scorpion\">The Black Scorpion<\/h4><p>The black scorpion tattoo design has been used by people for centuries. It&#8217;s one of the oldest symbols known to man. This symbol represents strength, power, and protection.<\/p><p>A scorpion tattoo represents the traits and attributes of the scorpion. Someone who gets this arachnid tatted on their body might want to send the message that they are deadly, stealthy, and not to be messed with. In addition to representing the scorpion&#8217;s characteristics, this tat could also be a symbol of a variety of other meanings, such as the zodiac sign Scorpio.<\/p><p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/blackpoisontattoos\/\">scorpion and rose tattoo<\/a> represents two living things that are not to be judged by their covers. The scorpion is small, yet intimidating, and the rose is beautiful but can hurt someone with its thorns. Both the scorpion and the rose should be admired from a distance. Getting a tattoo with a scorpion and rose means that you are someone. Who cannot be judged and that people should be wary when trying to get close to you. Either physically or spiritually. A scorpion with a rose tail could mean that you are a double-edged sword. You can sting, but you can also be pleasant.<\/p><p>Scorpion and rose tattoos convey to others that living things should not be judged by their appearances. Even though both are very beautiful, both the scorpion and the rose can bring about great pain and should be admired from afar. Those with scorpions and roses tattooed on their body send a message to others that it may be difficult to get emotionally or physically too close to them.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scorpion Tattoos are not that mainstream, they are popular.
