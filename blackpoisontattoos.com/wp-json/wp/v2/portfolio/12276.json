The brothers are skilled wizards who unite their powers to cross a river, where Death usually claims victims. Death schemes to trick them by offering each a gift. The eldest brother asks for an unbeatable wand, the second brother asks for the power to raise the dead, and the final brother asks for an invisibility cloak. Death claims the first two brothers, but the youngest brother lives until he is ready to take off the cloak and reveal himself to Death.<\/p><p>The Hallows united would supposedly make the person who owns them the master of Death itself.
