Ajit Singh was arrested and exiled to Rangoon in Burma (Myanmar), Swaran asked the people of Punjab to force the government for his release and due to his efforts, Ajit Singh was released from Rangoon jail in October 1907.<\/p><p>After coming back from jail, Ajit Singh decided to start a major revolt against the British. He began agitating the farmers and peasants to start a movement against them.<\/p><p>The British came to know of his intentions arrested him on 13 January 1911, when he was attending the Lohri festival celebration at his relative&#8217;s house.

At 2 pm as the boy Bhagat entered the bagh&#8217;s compound he saw blood scattered all over the ground. The turbans and torn clothes of people laid lifeless on the ground. The walls of the compound were red with blood. As it was a curfew in Punjab those days, the blood hadn&#8217;t been cleaned. Bhagat had taken a glass bottle with him before leaving from home. He took a handful of blood-stained soil and put it in the bottle. He reached home and put the bottle on in front of the Sikh gurus portrait and prayed to him for peace and solace for the victims of the massacre and he pledged to teach the British a lesson.<\/p><p>In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-cooperation movement to encourage a mass protest against the British and to boycott their trade in India, and to end their cooperation with British rule. Many people joined the movement and discarded the use of foreign goods and clothes. The people boycotted schools and colleges. The factories, industries, shops &amp; hospitals run by the government were all boycotted.
