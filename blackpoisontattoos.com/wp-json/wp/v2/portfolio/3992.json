There are other reasons to get a Roman numeral tattoo as well \u2013 for example, four siblings may choose to get the numeral IV tattooed onto all of them, as a reminder of how much they care for one another.<\/p><p>Roman numerals make for more interesting and striking tattoos than ordinary Arabic numbers, which is why they are so popular as tattoos.
