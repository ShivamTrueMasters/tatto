A quick look on different websites for tattoos will give you a repertoire of factual and mythical warriors. They are valued for the artistic part and the symbolism they offer. Warriors tattoos are usually done by men, although we do find a few nice warriors tattoed on females.<\/p><p>If you are looking to put a warrior tattoo design on any part of your body, your biggest problem is \u2018choice\u2019. There are so many aspects you can look at, that it is very important that you perform a thorough research so your end decision will be one that will keep you proud and happy for many years.<\/p><p>Warrior designs are period oriented, geographically located, real or fictitious, and even made up by the person who will be doing the tattoo. An important aspect of the warrior tattoo is the armor and tools he carries. The majority of warriors are men but as can be seen from the pictures below, we can occasionally encounter a beautiful female warrior. A popular female warrior is Pocahontas.<\/p><p>The choice of warrior tattoo designs is so vast that you will need time to make up your mind which warrior best describes you and your feelings. You can choose from Holy warriors, Greek warriors, Aztec warriors, Roman warriors, Celtic warriors, and Vikings, all of which represent a different aspect of war.<\/p><p>Other interesting additions to your tattoo are the weapons which range from the normal bow to the crossbows, spears, shields, different type of swords and also the armor and crests. It is very important that the correct armor is used with the kind of warrior you choose. You cannot include a crest which belongs to another era or is known to be the property of a different warrior.<\/p><p>Last but not least, one should also look at the positioning of the warrior. Usually, the warrior is tattooed standing on top of his enemy to show victory. Other warriors are shown in action, or on a bloody field. Most of the time the person who wants a warrior as a tattoo is looking for an aspect that shows his fighting spirit, bravery and courage, skill and strategy, his fearless character, power, aggressiveness and authority. Which one depicts you?<\/p><p>Each one of us is a warrior at heart, but whether we want to put this in the form of a tattoo on our skin is another story. If you are a fighter, want to portray some kind of anger, or admire the past and present warriors or soldiers, this might work perfectly for you. You might also be interested in different armour, fighting gear or the shiny swords used in wars. Another genre of such tattoos is movie fighters, which are also commonly asked for as tattoos. Whatever it is, carriers of warrior tattoos definitely have a fighting spirit they want to share with the rest of the world.<\/p><p>#warriortattoos #warriortattoos #warrior #tattoo #tattoos #tattooinspiration #tattooed #tattooedgirls #tattootour #newtattoo #tattooart #traditionaltattoo #anchortattoo #armtattoo #backtattoo #besttattoo #blackandgreytattoo #boldtattoo #customtattoo #handtattoo #letteringtattoo #liontattoo #skulltattoo #tattooaftercare #tattooartist #tattooedgirl #tattooedmen #tattoogallery #tattooidea #tattooing #tattooshop #tattoospecials #tattoosupplies #tattoosupply<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Warriors are popular tattoos which can be designed in an infinite number of forms.
