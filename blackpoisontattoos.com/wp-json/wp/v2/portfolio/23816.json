Shiva is often shown with many faces, as creator, destroyer and preserver in total command of the cosmos. He contains both good and evil. The main iconographical attributes of Shiva are the third eye on his forehead, the snake Vasuki around his neck, the crescent moon adorning, the holy river Ganga flowing from his matted hair, the Trishula as his weapon and the Damru as his musical instrument.He blesses his followers with grace, knowledge and peace.<span class=\"m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526Apple-converted-space m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blackpoisontattoos.com\/\"><strong>Om with Trishul<\/strong><\/a><\/p><p><span class=\"m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg\">As discuss above, that Shiva is the supreme Power among all gods. So shiva is the most favored and is the god of yogis too. So there are millions of people who worship lord shiva very truly. People want a design to reflect their spiritual beliefs, so people look out for shiva tattoo designs and symbols like Om and Trishula with the third eye.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg\">In different Eastern religion scriptures the Om, Trishula and third eye is a symbol of rich and deep meaning. That extends into the universe. The Om holds secrets far older than written texts. This symbol is used in chanting spiritual texts, &amp; has been a part of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain meditative practices for centuries.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg\"> Trishula has come to symbolize several important &#8216;triads&#8217;. First, there is the Hindu trinity of deities &#8211; Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. It also stands for the aspects and powers associated with these gods &#8212; Creation, Preservation, and Destruction.<span class=\"m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526Apple-converted-space m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg\">Take a look at these designs and tattoos and get your <\/span><span class=\"m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s2 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg\">Shiva <\/span><span class=\"m_2931458506270675906m_-6975705037395075526s1 m_2931458506270675906gmail_msg\">inspiration from here.<\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The three feminine (shakti) powers of will, action, and wisdom symbolized by the Trishula-Om Tattoo Inspired by the many meanings associated with the symbol we have come up with a beautiful art piece.
